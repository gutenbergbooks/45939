</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> undertaking the supervision of a new
edition of the <i>Reliques of Ancient English</i>
<i>Poetry</i>, I felt that no safer or better
guidance could be followed than that
of Bishop Percy himself; and as he always strove,
in the several editions published by himself, to embody
therein the sum of the knowledge of his times,
so I, following at a distance, have endeavoured, by
gathering from many quarters particulars published
since his death, to make his book still more worthy
of the great reputation it has acquired.</p>

<p>Each edition published during the lifetime of the
author contained large additions and corrections; but
since the publication of the fourth edition, in 1794,
no changes worth mentioning have been made, with
the exception of such as occur in a revision brought
out by the Rev. R. A. Willmott in 1857. His object,
however, was to form a handy volume, and he therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
cleared away all Percy's Essays and Prefaces,
and added short notices of his own, founded on
Percy's facts, and, in some instances, on recent
information.</p>

<p>The desire for a new edition of the <i>Reliques</i> has
more particularly grown since the publication of the
original folio MS. in 1867, and I trust that the
readers of the present edition may feel disposed to
accept it as in some degree satisfying this desire.</p>

<p>In the preparation of the present edition, the whole
of Percy's work has been reprinted from his fourth
edition, which contains his last touches; and in
order that no confusion should be occasioned to
the reader, all my notes and additions have been
placed between brackets. The chief of these are
the additional prefaces to the various pieces, the
glossarial notes at the foot of the page, and the
collation of such pieces as are taken from the folio
MS. The complete glossary, which will be appended
to the third volume, might seem to render the glossarial
notes unnecessary; but there may be some
readers who will find them useful. With regard to
the pieces taken from the folio MS., the originals
have been printed after Percy's copies in those
cases which had undergone considerable alterations.
Readers have now, therefore, before them complete
materials for forming an opinion as to the use the
Bishop made of his manuscript.</p>

<p>After commencing my work, I found that to treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
the Essays interspersed throughout the book as the
Prefaces had been treated, would necessitate so many
notes and corrections as to cause confusion; and as
the Essays on the English Stage, and the Metrical
Romances, are necessarily out of date, the trouble
expended would not have been repaid by the utility
of the result. I have, therefore, thrown them to
the end of their respective volumes, where they can
be read exactly as Percy left them.</p>

<p>In concluding these explanations, I have much
pleasure in expressing my thanks to those friends
who have assisted me, and to those writers without
whose previous labours mine could not have
been performed, more particularly to Messrs. Furnivall
and Hales, who most kindly gave me permission
to use any part of their edition of the folio
MS. To Mr. Hales I am also indebted for many
valuable hints, of which I have gladly availed
myself.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Several</span> questions of general interest
have arisen for discussion by the editor
during the work of revision. Notes
upon these have been brought together,
so as to form an introduction, which it
is hoped may be of some use to the readers of the
<i>Reliques</i>, in the absence of an exhaustive compilation,
which has yet to be made. Here there is no attempt
at completeness of treatment, and the notes are
roughly arranged under the following headings:&mdash;</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Minstrels.</span></h3>

<p>When Percy wrote the opening sentence in his
first sketch of that "Essay on the Ancient English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
Minstrels" (1765), which was the foundation of
the literature of the subject, he little expected the
severe handling he was to receive from the furious
Ritson for his hasty utterance. His words were,
"The minstrels seem to have been the genuine
successors of the ancient bards, who united the
arts of poetry and music, and sung verses to the
harp of their own composing." The bishop was
afterwards convinced, from Ritson's remarks, that
the rule he had enunciated was too rigid, and in the
later form of the Essay he somewhat modified his
language. The last portion of the sentence then
stood, "composed by themselves or others," and a
note was added to the effect that he was "wedded
to no hypothesis."</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott criticised the controversy in his
interesting article on <i>Romance</i> in the supplement
to the <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>, where he wrote:
"When so popular a department of poetry has attained
this decided character, it becomes time to
inquire who were the composers of these numerous,
lengthened, and once-admired narratives which are
called metrical romances, and from whence they
drew their authority. Both these subjects of discussion
have been the source of great controversy
among antiquarians; a class of men who, be it said
with their forgiveness, are apt to be both positive
and polemical upon the very points which are least
susceptible of proof, and which are least valuable if
the truth could be ascertained; and which, therefore,
we would gladly have seen handled with more diffidence
and better temper in proportion to their uncertainty."
After some remarks upon the essays of
Percy and Ritson, he added, "Yet there is so little
room for this extreme loss of temper, that upon a
recent perusal of both these ingenious essays, we
were surprised to find that the reverend editor of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
<i>Reliques</i> and the accurate antiquary have differed
so very little as in essential facts they appear to
have done. Quotations are indeed made by both
with no sparing hand; and hot arguments, and on
one side, at least, hard words are unsparingly employed;
while, as is said to happen in theological
polemics, the contest grows warmer in proportion as
the ground concerning which it is carried on
is narrower and more insignificant. In reality
their systems do not essentially differ." Ritson's
great object was to set forth more clearly than
Percy had done that the term <i>minstrel</i> was a comprehensive
one, including the poet, the singer, and
the musician, not to mention the <i>fablier</i>, <i>conteur</i>,
<i>jugleur</i>, <i>baladin</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Ritson delighted in collecting instances of the degradation
into which the minstrel gradually sank, and,
with little of Percy's taste, he actually preferred the
ballad-writer's songs to those of the minstrel. Percy,
on the other hand, gathered together all the material
he could to set the minstrel in a good light.
There is abundant evidence that the latter was right
in his view of the minstrel's position in feudal times,
but there were grades in this profession as in others,
and law-givers doubtless found it necessary to control
such Bohemians as wandered about the country
without licence. The minstrel of a noble house was
distinguished by bearing the badge of his lord attached
to a silver chain, and just as in later times
the players who did not bear the name of some
courtier were the subjects of parliamentary enactments,
so the unattached minstrels were treated as
vagrants. Besides the minstrels of great lords, there
were others attached to important cities. On May 26,
1298, as appears by the Wardrobe accounts of Edward
I., that king gave 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> to Walter Lovel, the
harper of Chichester, whom he found playing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
harp before the tomb of St. Richard in the Cathedral
of Chichester.</p>

<p>Waits were formerly attached to most corporate
towns, and were, in fact, the corporation minstrels.
They wore a livery and a badge, and were
formed into a sort of guild. No one, even were he
an inhabitant of the town, was suffered to play in
public who was not free of the guild. Besides singing
out the hours of the night, and warning the
town against dangers, they accompanied themselves
with the harp, the pipe, the hautboy, and other instruments.
They played in the town for the gratification
of the inhabitants, and attended the mayor on
all state occasions. At the mayor's feast they occupied
the minstrels' gallery. From the merchants'
guild book at Leicester, it appears that as early as
1314 "Hugh the Trumpeter" was made free of the
guild, and in 1481 "Henry Howman, a harper," was
also made free, while in 1499 "Thomas Wylkyns,
Wayte," and in 1612 "Thomas Pollard, musician,"
were likewise admitted.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Percy collected so many facts concerning the
old minstrels, that it is not necessary to add much
to his stock of information, especially as, though
a very interesting subject in itself, it has really
very little to do with the contents of the <i>Reliques</i>.</p>

<p>The knightly Troubadours and Trouv&egrave;res, and
such men as Taillefer, the Norman minstrel, who
at the battle of Hastings advanced on horseback
before the invading host, and gave the signal for
attack by singing the Song of Roland, who died at
Roncesvalles, had little in common with the authors
of the ballads in this book.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p>
<p>The wise son of Sirach enumerates among those
famous men who are worthy to be praised "such as
found out musical tunes, and recited verses in writing;"
but, according to Hector Boece, the early
Scottish kings thought otherwise. In the Laws of
Kenneth II., "bardis" are mentioned with vagabonds,
fools, and idle persons, to be scourged and
burnt on the cheek, unless they found some work by
which to live; and the same laws against them were,
according to Boece, still in force in the reign of Macbeth,
nearly two centuries later. Better times, however,
came, and Scotch bards and minstrels were
highly favoured in the reign of James III.; but the
sunshine did not last long. In 1574, "pipers, fiddlers,
and minstrels" are again branded with the opprobrious
term of vagabonds, and threatened with severe
penalties; and the Regent Morton induced the Privy
Council to issue an edict that "nane tak upon hand
to emprent or sell whatsoever book, ballet, or other
werk," without its being examined and licensed, under
pain of death and confiscation of goods. In August,
1579, two poets of Edinburgh (William Turnbull,
schoolmaster, and William Scot, notar, "baith weel
belovit of the common people for their common
offices"), were hanged for writing a satirical ballad
against the Earl of Morton; and in October of the
same year, the Estates passed an Act against beggars
and "sic as make themselves fules and are
bards ... minstrels, sangsters, and tale tellers, not
avowed in special service by some of the lords of parliament
or great burghs."</p>

<p>The minstrels had their several rounds, and, as a
general rule, did not interfere with each other; but it
is probable that they occasionally made a foray into
other districts, in order to replenish their worn-out
stock of songs.</p>

<p>One of the last of the true minstrels was Richard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
Sheale, who enjoys the credit of having preserved
the old version of <i>Chevy Chase</i>. He was for a
time in the service of Edward, Earl of Derby,
and wrote an elegy on the Countess, who died
in January, 1558. He afterwards followed the profession
of a minstrel at Tamworth, and his wife
was a "sylke woman," who sold shirts, head clothes,
and laces, &amp;c., at the fairs of Lichfield and other
neighbouring towns. On one occasion, when he left
Tamworth on horseback, with his harp in his hand,
he had the misfortune to be robbed by four highwaymen,
who lay in wait for him near Dunsmore Heath.
He wrote a long account of his misfortune in verse,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
in which he describes the grief of himself and his
wife at their great loss, and laments over the coldness
of worldly friends. He was robbed of threescore
pounds&mdash;a large amount in those days&mdash;not obtained,
however, from the exercise of his own skill, but by
the sale of his wife's wares. This money was to be
devoted to the payment of their debts, and in order
that the carriage of it should not be a burden to him
he changed it all for gold. He thought he might
carry it safely, as no one would suspect a minstrel of
possessing so much property, but he found to his
cost that he had been foolishly bold. To add to his
affliction, some of his acquaintances grieved him by
saying that he was a lying knave, and had not been
robbed, as it was not possible for a minstrel to have
so much money. There was a little sweetness, however,
in the poor minstrel's cup, for patrons were
kind, and his loving neighbours at Tamworth exerted
themselves to help him. They induced him to brew
a bushel of malt, and sell the ale.</p>

<p>All this is related in a poem, which gives a vivid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>picture of the life of the time, although the verse
does not do much credit to the poet's skill.</p>

<p>When the minstrel class had fallen to utter decay
in England, it flourished with vigour in Wales; and
we learn that the harpers and fiddlers were prominent
figures in the Cymmortha, or gatherings of the
people for mutual aid. These assemblies were of a
similar character to the "Bees," which are common
among our brethren in the United States. They
were often abused for political purposes, and they
gave some trouble to Burghley as they had previously
done to Henry IV. In the reign of that king a
statute was passed forbidding rhymers, minstrels,
&amp;c. from making the Cymmortha. The following
extract from a MS. in the Lansdowne Collection in
the British Museum, on the state of Wales in Elizabeth's
reign, shows the estimation in which the minstrels
were then held:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Upon the Sundays and holidays the multitudes
of all sorts of men, women, and children of every
parish do use to meet in sundry places, either on
some hill or on the side of some mountain, where
their harpers and crowthers sing them songs of the
doings of their ancestors."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Ben Jonson introduces "Old Father Rosin," the
chief minstrel of Highgate, as one of the principal
characters in his <i>Tale of a Tub</i>; and the blind
harpers continued for many years to keep up the remembrance
of the fallen glories of the minstrel's profession.
Tom D'Urfey relates how merrily <i>blind</i>
<i>Tom</i> harped, and mention is made of "honest Jack
Nichols, the harper," in Tom Brown's <i>Letters from</i>
<i>the Dead to the Living</i> (Works, ii. 191). Sir Walter
Scott, in the article on <i>Romance</i> referred to above,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>tells us that "about fifty or sixty years since" (which
would be about the year 1770) "a person acquired
the nickname of 'Roswal and Lillian,' from singing
that romance about the streets of Edinburgh, which is
probably the very last instance of the proper minstrel
craft." Scott himself, however, gives later instances in
the introduction to the <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i>.
He there writes: "It is certain that till a very late
period the pipers, of whom there was one attached to
each border town of note, and whose office was often
hereditary, were the great depositaries of oral, and
particularly of poetical tradition. About spring-time,
and after harvest, it was the custom of these musicians
to make a progress through a particular district of
the country. The music and the tale repaid their
lodging, and they were usually gratified, with a donation
of seed corn. This order of minstrels is alluded
to in the comic song of <i>Maggy Lauder</i>, who thus addresses
a piper:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Live ye upo' the border?'"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To this is added the following note:&mdash;"These town
pipers, an institution of great antiquity upon the
borders, were certainly the last remains of the minstrel
race. Robin Hastie, town piper of Jedburgh,
perhaps the last of the order, died nine or ten years
ago; his family was supposed to have held the office
for about three centuries. Old age had rendered
Robin a wretched performer, but he knew several
old songs and tunes, which have probably died
along with him. The town-pipers received a livery
and salary from the community to which they belonged;
and in some burghs they had a small allotment
of land, called the Pipers' Croft." Scott further
adds:&mdash;"Other itinerants, not professed musicians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>found their welcome to their night's quarters readily
ensured by their knowledge in legendary lore. John
Gr&aelig;me, of Sowport, in Cumberland, commonly
called the Long Quaker, a person of this latter
description, was very lately alive, and several of the
songs now published have been taken down from
his recitation." A note contains some further particulars
of this worthy:&mdash;"This person, perhaps the
last of our professed ballad reciters, died since the
publication of the first edition of this work. He
was by profession an itinerant cleaner of clocks and
watches, but a stentorian voice and tenacious
memory qualified him eminently for remembering
accurately and reciting with energy the border
gathering songs and tales of war. His memory was
latterly much impaired, yet the number of verses
which he could pour forth, and the animation of his
tone and gestures, formed a most extraordinary contrast
to his extreme feebleness of person and dotage
of mind." Ritson, in mentioning some relics of
the minstrel class, writes:&mdash;"It is not long since
that the public papers announced the death of a
person of this description somewhere in Derbyshire;
and another from the county of Gloucester was
within these few years to be seen in the streets of
London; he played on an instrument of the rudest
construction, which he properly enough called a
<i>humstrum</i>, and chanted (amongst others) the old
ballad of <i>Lord Thomas and Fair Eleanor</i>, which, by
the way, has every appearance of being originally a
minstrel song." He adds further in a note:&mdash;"He
appeared again in January, 1790, and called upon
the present writer in the April following. He was
between sixty and seventy years of age, but had not
been brought up to the profession of a minstrel, nor
possessed any great store of songs, of which that
mentioned in the text seemed the principal. Having,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
it would seem, survived his minstrel talents, and
forgot his epic, nay Pindaric art, he has been of late
frequently observed begging in the streets."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>These quotations relate to the end of the last
or to the very early part of the present century, but
we can add a notice of minstrels who lived well on
towards the middle of this century. Mr. J. H.
Dixon, in the preface to his <i>Scottish Traditional</i>
<i>Versions of Ancient Ballads</i>, printed for the Percy
Society in 1845, writes as follows:&mdash;"Although the
harp has long been silent in the dales of the north
of England and Scotland, it has been succeeded by
the violin, and a class of men are still in existence
and pursuing their calling, who are the regular descendants
and representatives of the minstrels of
old. In his rambles amongst the hills of the North,
and especially in the wild and romantic dales of
Yorkshire, the editor has met with several of these
characters. They are not idle vagabonds who have
no other calling, but in general are honest and industrious,
though poor men, having a local habitation
as well as a name, and engaged in some calling,
pastoral or manual. It is only at certain periods,
such as Christmas, or some other of the great festal
seasons of the ancient church, that they take up the
minstrel life, and levy contributions in the hall of the
peer or squire, and in the cottage of the farmer or
peasant. They are in general well-behaved, and
often very witty fellows, and therefore their visits
are always welcome. These minstrels do not sing
modern songs, but, like their brethren of a bygone
age, they keep to the ballads. The editor has in
his possession some old poems, which he obtained
from one of these minstrels, who is still living and
fiddling in Yorkshire."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span></p>
<p>In his <i>Ancient Poems, Ballads, and Songs of the</i>
<i>Peasantry of England</i>, 1846, Mr. Dixon notices one
of these relics of the past, viz. Francis King, who
was well known in the western dales of Yorkshire
as "the Skipton Minstrel:"&mdash;"This poor minstrel,
from whose recitation two of our ballads were obtained,
met his death by drowning in December,
1844. He had been at a merry meeting at Gargrave
in Craven, and it is supposed that owing to
the darkness of the night he had mistaken his
homeward road, and walked into the water. He
was one in whose character were combined the
mimic and the minstrel, and his old jokes and older
ballads and songs ever insured him a hearty welcome.
His appearance was peculiar, and owing to
one leg being shorter than its companion, he walked
in such a manner as once drew from a wag the
remark, 'that few <i>kings</i> had had more ups and
downs in the world!' As a musician his talents
were creditable, and some of the dance tunes that
he was in the habit of composing showed that he
was not deficient in the organ of melody. In the
quiet churchyard of Gargrave may be seen the
minstrel's grave."</p>

<p>Percy wrote an interesting note upon the division
of some of the long ballads into fits (see vol. ii. p. 182).
The minstrel's payment for each of these fits was a
groat; and so common was this remuneration, that
a groat came to be generally spoken of as "fiddler's
money."</p>

<p>Puttenham describes the blind harpers and tavern
minstrels as giving a fit of mirth for a groat; and in
Ben Jonson's <i>masque of the Metamorphosed Gipsies</i>,
1621, Townshead, the clown, cries out, "I cannot
hold now; there's my groat, let's have a fit for mirth
sake."</p>

<p>The payment seems to have remained the same,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
though the money became in time reduced in value,
so that, as the minstrel fell in repute, his reward became
less. In 1533, however, a Scotch eighteen-penny
groat possessed a considerable buying power,
as appears from the following extract:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sir Walter Coupar, chaplaine in Edinburghe, gate
a pynte of vyne, a laiffe of 36 vnce vaight, a peck of
aite meill, a pynte of aill, a scheipe head, ane penny
candell and a faire woman for ane xviii. penny
grotte."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>After the Restoration, the sixpence took the place
of the groat; and it is even now a current phrase to
say, when several sixpences are given in change,
"What a lot of fiddlers' money!"</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ballads and Ballad Writers.</span></h3>

<p>One of the most important duties of the old minstrel
was the chanting of the long romances of chivalry,
and the question whether the ballads were
detached portions of the romances, or the romances
built up from ballads, has greatly agitated the minds
of antiquaries. There seems reason to believe that
in a large number of instances the most telling portions
of the romance were turned into ballads, and
this is certainly the case in regard to several of those
belonging to the Arthurian cycle. On the other side,
such poems as Barbour's <i>Bruce</i> and Blind Harry's
<i>Wallace</i> have, according to Motherwell, swept out of
existence the memory of the ballads from which they
were formed. When Barbour wrote, ballads relative
to Bruce and his times were common, "for the poet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>in speaking of certain 'thre worthi poyntis of wer,'
omits the particulars of the 'thrid which fell into
Esdaill,' being a victory gained by 'Schyr Johne
the Soullis,' over 'Schyr Andrew Hardclay,' for
this reason:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'I will nocht rehers the maner,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wha sa likes thai may her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young wemen quhen thai will play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Syng it amang thaim ilk day.'"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another instance of the agglutinative process may
be cited in the gradual growth of the Robin Hood
ballads into a sort of epic, the first draught of which
we may see in the <i>Merrye Geste</i>. The directness
and dramatic cast of the minstrel ballad, however,
form a strong argument in favour of the theory that
they were largely taken from the older romances and
chronicles, and the fragmentary appearance of some
of them gives force to this view. Without preface,
they go at once straight to the incident to be described.
Frequently the ballad opens with a conversation,
and some explanation of the position of the
interlocutors was probably given by the minstrel as
a prose introduction. Motherwell, in illustration of
the opinion that the abrupt transitions of the ballads
were filled up by the explanations of the minstrels,
gives the following modern instance:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Traces of such a custom still remain in the lowlands
of Scotland among those who have stores of
these songs upon their memory. Reciters frequently,
when any part of the narrative appears incomplete,
supply the defect in prose.... I have heard the
ancient ballad of <i>Young Beichan and Susan Pye</i>
dilated by a story-teller into a tale of very remarkable
dimensions&mdash;a paragraph of prose, and then a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span><i>screed</i> of rhyme, alternately given. From this ballad
I may give a short specimen, after the fashion of the
venerable authority from whom I quote: 'Well ye
must know that in the Moor's castle there was a
massymore, which is a dark, deep dungeon for keeping
prisoners. It was twenty feet below the ground,
and into this hole they closed poor Beichan. There
he stood, night and day, up to his waist in puddle
water; but night or day, it was all one to him, for no
ae styme of light ever got in. So he lay there a long
and weary while, and thinking on his heavy weird,
he made a mournfu' sang to pass the time, and this
was the sang that he made, and grat when he sang
it, for he never thought of ever escaping from the
massymore, or of seeing his ain country again:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My hounds they all ran masterless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hawks they flee from tree to tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My youngest brother will heir my lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair England again I'll never see.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh were I free as I hae been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my ship swimming once more on sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd turn my face to fair England,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sail no more to a strange countrie.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>'Now the cruel Moor had a beautiful daughter, called
Susan Pye, who was accustomed to take a walk every
morning in her garden, and as she was walking ae
day she heard the sough o' Beichan's sang, coming, as
it were, from below the ground,'" &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The contrast between the construction of minstrel
ballads and those of the ballad-mongers who arose as
a class in the reign of Elizabeth is very marked. The
ballad-singers who succeeded the minstrels were sufficiently
wise not to reject the treasures of their predecessors,
and many of the old songs were rewritten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>and lengthened to suit their purpose. <i>Sir Patrick</i>
<i>Spence</i> would perhaps be the best of the minstrel
ballads to oppose to one of the best of the later ballads,
such as the <i>Beggar's Daughter of Bednall Green</i>;
but as its authenticity has been disputed, it will be
well to choose another, and <i>Captaine Carre</i>, which
Ritson allows to have been one of the few minstrel
ballads he acknowledges, will do well for the purpose.
As both these poems are before our readers, it will
only be necessary to quote the first stanzas of each.
The version in the folio MS. of <i>Captain Carre</i> commences
abruptly thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"ffaith maister, whither you will,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">whereas you like the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">unto the castle of Bitton's borrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and there to take your rest."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is a remarkable contrast to the opening of
the <i>Beggar's Daughter</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Itt was a blind beggar, had long lost his sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had a faire daughter of bewty most bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a gallant brave suiter had shee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For none was soe comelye as pretty Bessee."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some may think, however, that this ballad is an
adaptation by the ballad-monger from an older
original, so that perhaps a still better instance of
the great change in form that the ballads underwent
will be found in the <i>Children in the Wood</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
This favourite ballad is one of the best specimens
of that didactic style which is so natural in the
hands of the master, but degenerates into such tedious
twaddle when copied by the pupil. The first stanza
is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now ponder well, you parents deare,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These wordes, which I shall write;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A doleful story you shall heare,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>
<span class="i2">In time brought forth to light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gentleman of good account<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In Norfolke dwelt of late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who did in honour far surmount<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Most men of his estate."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To put the matter simply, we may say that the
writer of the old minstrel ballad expected an unhesitating
belief for all his statements. "If fifteen
stalwart foresters are slain by one stout knight,
single-handed, he never steps out of his way to
prove the truth of such an achievement by appealing
to the exploits of some other notable manslayer."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
On the other hand the professional
ballad-writer gives a reason for everything he
states, and in consequence fills his work with redundancies.
Percy understood the characteristics
of the older ballads, and explained the difference
between the two classes of ballads in his <i>Essay on</i>
<i>the Ancient Minstrels</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but unfortunately he did not
bear the distinction in mind when he altered some of
the ballads in the folio MS. So that we find it to
have been his invariable practice to graft the prettinesses
and redundancies of the later writers upon
the simplicity of the earlier. For instance, in his
version of <i>Sir Cauline</i> he inserts such well-worn
saws as the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Everye white will have its blacke,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And everye sweete its sowre:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This founde the ladye Cristabelle<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In an untimely howre."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ritson also remarks upon the distinctive styles of
the ancient and modern writers, but, as observed
above, he had the bad taste to prefer the work of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>the later ballad-writer. His opinion is given in the
following passage:&mdash;"These songs [of the minstrels]
from their wild and licentious metre were incapable
of any certain melody or air; they were chanted in
a monotonous stile to the harp or other instrument,
and both themselves and the performers banished
by the introduction of ballad-singers without instruments,
who sung printed pieces to fine and simple
melodies, possibly of their own invention, most of
which are known and admired at this day. The
latter, owing to the smoothness of their language,
and accuracy of their measure and rime, were
thought to be more poetical than the old harp or
instrument songs; and though critics may judge
otherwise, the people at large were to decide, and
did decide: and in some respects, at least, not without
justice, as will be evident from a comparison of
the following specimens.</p>

<p>"The first is from the old <i>Chevy Chase</i>, a very
popular minstrel ballad in the time of Queen Elizabeth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The Pers&eacute; owt of Northombarlande,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a vowe to God mayd he,' &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How was it possible that this barbarous language,
miserably chanted 'by some blind crowder with no
rougher voice than rude stile,' should maintain its
ground against such lines as the following, sung
to a beautiful melody, which we know belongs to
them?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'When as king Henry rul'd the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The second of that name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides the queen he dearly lov'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A fair and comely dame,' &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The minstrels would seem to have gained little by
such a contest. In short, they gave up the old <i>Chevy</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span><i>Chase</i> to the ballad-singers, who, desirous, no doubt,
to avail themselves of so popular a subject, had it
new written, and sung it to the favourite melody just
mentioned. The original, of course, became utterly
neglected, and but for its accidental discovery by
Hearne, would never have been known to exist."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Percy held the view, which was afterwards advocated
by Scott, that the Borders were the true home
of the romantic ballad, and that the chief minstrels
originally belonged either to the north of England or
the south of Scotland;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> but later writers have found
the relics of a ballad literature in the north of Scotland.
The characteristics of the ballad doubtless
varied to some extent in different parts of the
country, but there is no reason to believe that the
glory of being its home can be confined to any one
place. Unfortunately this popular literature was
earlier lost in the plains than among the hills, while
the recollection of the fatal fields of Otterburn, Humbledon,
Flodden, Halidon, Hedgeley, Hexham, &amp;c.,
would naturally keep it alive longer among the
families of the Border than elsewhere.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further, it may be as well to say
a few words upon the word <i>ballad</i>. The strong line
of demarcation that is now drawn between an ordinary
song and a ballad is a late distinction, and even Dr.
Johnson's only explanation of the word "ballad" in
his <i>Dictionary</i> is "a song." One of his quotations is
taken from Watts, to the effect that "ballad once
signified a solemn and sacred song, as well as trivial,
when Solomon's Song was called the ballad of ballads;
but now it is applied to nothing but trifling verse."
The "balade" as used by Chaucer and others was a
song written in a particular rhythm, but later writers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>usually meant by a ballad a song that was on the lips
of the people.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to enlarge here upon the change
of meaning that the word has undergone, nor to do
more than mention the relation that it bears to the
word ballet. As a <i>ballad</i> is now a story told in verse,
so a <i>ballet</i> is now a story told in a dance. Originally
the two were one, and the ballad was a song sung
while the singers were dancing.</p>

<p>When Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun wrote, "I
knew a very wise man, so much of Sir Christopher's
sentiment that he believed if a man were permitted
to make all the ballads, he need not care who should
make the laws of a nation," he referred to the popular
songs of the people, but, in point of fact, a nation
makes its own ballads, which do not become current
coin until stamped with public approval. No song
will change a people's purpose, but the national heart
will be found written in a country's songs as a reflection
of what has happened.</p>

<p>The successful ballad-writer requires a quick eye
and ear to discern what is smouldering in the public
mind, and then if his words fall in with the humour
of the people his productions will have a powerful
influence, and may set the country in a blaze. <i>&Ccedil;a</i>
<i>ira</i> and the <i>Carmagnole</i> had much influence on
the progress of the great French Revolution, as
<i>Mourir pour la Patrie</i> had upon that of 1848.
<i>Lilliburlero</i> gave the finishing stroke to the
English Revolution of 1688, and its author (Lord
Wharton) boasted that he had rhymed King James
out of his dominions.</p>

<p>The old ballad filled the place of the modern
newspaper, and history can be read in ballads by
those who try to understand them; but the type is
often blurred, and in attempting to make out their
meaning, we must be careful not to see too much,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>
for the mere fact of the existence of a ballad does
not prove its popularity or its truth.</p>

<p>Literature is often presumed to assert a larger
influence over a nation than it really does, and there
is little doubt that literature is more a creation of
the people than the people are a creation of literature.
Where a healthy public opinion exists, people
are less affected to action by what is written than is
sometimes supposed, but still there is an important
reflex action, and&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Words are things, and a small drop of ink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falling like dew upon a thought, produces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That which makes thousands, perhaps millions, think."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are recorded instances of the powerful
influence of ballads, and we know how much Dibdin's
sea songs did for the British navy, when they
placed before the sailor an ideal of his own feelings,
and painted men he wished to be like.</p>

<p>The songs of a country are the truly natural part
of its poetry, and really the only poetry of the great
body of the people. Percy, in the dedication to his
<i>Reliques</i>, calls ballads the "barbarous productions
of unpolished ages." Nevertheless they are instinct
with life, and live still, while much of the polished
poetry of his age, which expelled nature from literature,
is completely dead. Nature is the salt that
keeps the ballad alive, and many have maintained a
continuance of popularity for several centuries.</p>

<p>A good ballad is not an easy thing to write, and
many poets who have tried their hand at composition
in this branch of their art have signally failed, as may
be seen by referring to some of the modern pieces
in this book, which Percy hoped would "atone for
the rudeness of the more obsolete poems."</p>

<p>The true ballad is essentially dramatic, and one
that is to make itself felt should be all action, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>
any moralizing padding, for it is a narrative in
verse meant for the common people. James Hogg,
himself a successful ballad-writer, has something to
say about a good song: "A man may be sair mista'en
about many things, sic as yepics, an' tragedies,
an' tales, an' even lang set elegies about the death
o' great public characters, an' hymns, an' odes, an'
the like, but he canna be mista'en about a sang. As
sune as it's down on the sclate I ken whether it's
gude, bad, or middlin'. If any of the two last I dight
it out wi' my elbow; if the first, I copy it o'er into
writ and then get it aff by heart, when it's as sure
o' no' being lost as if it war engraven on a brass
plate. For though I hae a treacherous memory
about things in ordinar', a' my happy sangs will
cleave to my heart to my dying day, an' I should na
wonder gin I war to croon a verse or twa frae some
o' them on my deathbed."</p>

<p>All ballads are songs, but all songs are not ballads,
and the difference between a ballad and a song is
something the same as that between a proverb and
an apophthegm, for the ballad like the proverb should
be upon many lips. A poet may write a poem and
call it a ballad: but it requires the public approval
before it becomes one in fact.</p>

<p>The objects of the minstrel and the ballad-singer
were essentially different: thus the minstrel's stock
of ballads usually lasted him his lifetime, and as his
living depended upon them they were jealously
guarded by him from others. Nothing he objected
to more than to see them in print. The chief aim
of the ballad-singer, on the other hand, was to sell
his collection of printed broadsides, and to obtain
continually a new stock, so as to excite the renewed
attention of his customers.</p>

<p>Henry Chettle mentions in his <i>Kind Hart's Dream</i>,
1592, the sons of one Barnes, who boasted that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>
could earn twenty shillings a day by singing ballads
at Bishop's Stortford and places in the neighbourhood.
The one had a squeaking treble, the other
"an ale-blown bass."</p>

<p>One of the most popular singers of the early time
was a boy named Cheeke, and nicknamed "Outroaring
Dick." He was originally a mechanic, but
renounced that life for ballad-singing, by which
occupation he earned ten shillings a day. He was
well known in Essex, and was not missed for many
years from the great fair at Braintree. He had a
rival in Will Wimbars, who sung chiefly doleful
tragedies. Mat Nash, a man from the "North
Countrie," made the Border ballads his own by his
manner of singing them, in which he accompanied
his voice by dramatic action. <i>Chevy Chase</i> was
his <i>tour de force</i>. Lord Burghley was so pleased
with his singing that he enabled him to retire
from his occupation. The gipsies have furnished
many female singers, and one of them, named
Alice Boyce, who came to London in Elizabeth's
reign, paid the expenses of her journey up to London
by singing the whole way. She had the
honour of singing, "O, the broom" and "Lady
Green Sleeves" before the queen. Gravelot, the
portrait painter in the Strand, had several sittings
from ballad-singers; and Hogarth drew the famous
"Philip in the Tub" in his Wedding of the <i>Industrious</i>
<i>Apprentice</i>.</p>

<p>Street singing still continues, and one of the songs
of thirty years ago tells of "the luck of a cove wot
sings," and how many friends he has. One of the
verses is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"While strolling t'other night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I dropped in a house, d'ye see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The landlord so polite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Insisted on treating me;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I called for a glass of port,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When half-a-bottle he brings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'How much?'&mdash;'Nothing of the sort,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says he, 'you're a cove wot sings.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Chappell gives a large number of early quotations
relating to ballad-singing, in his interesting <i>History</i>
<i>of Ballad Literature</i>, and observes that "some
idea of the number of ballads that were printed in
the early part of the reign of Elizabeth may be
formed from the fact that seven hundred and ninety-six
ballads left for entry at Stationers' Hall remained
in the cupboard of the Council Chamber of the Company
at the end of the year 1560, to be transferred to
the new Wardens, and only forty-four books."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Some
of the old writers, like Shakspere's Mopsa, loved "a
ballad in print;" but more of them disliked the new
literature that was rising up like a mushroom, and
took every opportunity of having a fling at it.</p>

<p>Webbe, in his <i>Discourse of English Poetrie</i> (1586),
refers to "the un-countable rabble of ryming ballet-makers
and compylers of senseless sonnets;" and
Chettle complains in <i>Kind Hart's Dream</i> (1592),
that "now ballads are abusively chanted in every
street; and from London, this evil has overspread
Essex and the adjoining counties. There is many a
tradesman of a worshipful trade, yet no stationer,
who after a little bringing up apprentices to singing
brokery, takes into his shop some fresh men, and
trusts his servants of two months' standing with a
dozen groats' worth of ballads, in which, if they prove
thrifty, he makes them pretty chapmen, able to
spread more pamphlets by the State forbidden than
all the booksellers in London." Bishop Hall (1597)
does not forget to satirize ballad-writing among other
things more worthy of censure.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Some drunken rhymer thinks his time well spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he can live to see his name in print;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, when he is once fleshed to the presse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sees his handsell have such faire successe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sung to the wheele and sung unto the payle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sends forth thraves of ballads to the sale."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That is, by the spinsters and milkmaids. Shakspere
also refers to the love which women at work have for
a ballad in <i>Twelfth Night</i> (act i. sc. 4):</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The spinsters and knitters in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the free maids that weave their thread with bones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do use to chant it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The larger number of ballads are anonymous, but
we are told that in the reign of Henry VIII., "the
most pregnant wits" were employed in writing
them, and that the king himself set the example.
The ballad, however, here referred to probably
only meant an ordinary song. In course of time
rhymesters succeeded poets, because, as the world
becomes more educated, the poet confines himself
to the refined, and the people have to content
themselves with poor poetasters. Stirring times
will, however, always give birth to some real poetry
among the masses, because whatever is true and
earnest must find an echo in many hearts. In Elizabeth's
reign, as we have already seen, the ballad-writer
had sunk very low in public esteem. In further
illustration of this we find in <i>Martin Mar-sixtus</i>
(1592) the following diatribe: "I lothe to speak it,
every red-nosed rhymester is an auther, every
drunken man's dream is a book; and he whose
talent of little wit is hardly worth a farthing, yet
layeth about him so outrageously as if all Helicon
had run through his pen. In a word, scarce a cat
can look out of a gutter, but out starts a halfpenny
chronicler, and presently a proper new ballet of a
strange sight is indited." The producer and the product<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>
had not greatly changed in forty years, for we
find the following character in the curious little book,
entitled <i>Whimzies, or a New Cast of Characters</i>
(1631):</p>

<p>"A ballad-monger is the ignominious nickname of
a penurious poet, of whom he partakes in nothing
but in povertie. He has a singular gift of imagination,
for he can descant on a man's execution long
before his confession. Nor comes his invention far
short of his imagination. For want of truer relations,
for a neede, he can finde you out a Sussex dragon,
some sea or inland monster, drawne out by some
Shoe-lane man in a Gorgon-like feature, to enforce
more horror in the beholder."</p>

<p>The chief of the ballad-writers were William Elderton,
Thomas Deloney, Richard Johnson, and Anthony
Munday. Elderton was known as the prince of ballad-mongers;
but, unfortunately, he was as notorious for
his love of the bottle, and he is said to have drunk
himself to death before the year 1592. Camden tells
us that "he did arm himself with ale (as old Father
Ennius did with wine) when he ballated," and two
epitaphs made upon him are registered in the <i>Remaines</i>,
the Latin one of which is also printed at
p. 221 of vol. ii., with Oldys's translation, and the
following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here is Elderton lying in dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or lying Elderton; chuse which you lust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here he lies dead, I do him no wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who knew him standing, all his life long?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nash asserts that "Elderton consumed his alecrammed
nose to nothing in bear-bayting" an enemy
"with whole bundells of ballets;"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and Gabriel Harvey
attacks "Father Elderton and his son Greene
as the ringleaders of the riming and scribbling crew."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span></p>
<p>According to Stow, Elderton was an attorney in the
Sheriffs' Courts of the City of London, and wrote
some verses on the new porch and stone statues at
Guildhall. Ritson does not think that his poetical
powers are to be compared with those of Deloney and
Johnson. Drayton also appears to have had a low
opinion of him, for he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I scorn'd your ballad then, though it were done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had for finis, William Elderton,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but Benedick, in <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> (act v.
sc. 2) does him the honour of singing one of his
songs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The god of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sits above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knows me, and knows me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How pitiful I deserve."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thomas Deloney, the shoemaker's historiographer,
was a voluminous writer of ballads, which he himself
collected into Garlands, with different taking titles.
Several of his pieces are printed in these volumes.
Nash calls him "the balleting silk-weaver of Norwich;"
and in his <i>Have with you to Saffron Walden</i>,
he remarks on the ballad-maker's change of style:
"He hath rhyme enough for all miracles, and wit to
make a <i>Garland of Good Will</i>, &amp;c., but whereas his
muse, from the first peeping forth, hath stood at livery
at an ale-house wisp, never exceeding a penny a quart,
day or night&mdash;and this dear year, together with the
silencing of his looms, scarce that&mdash;he is constrained
to betake himself to carded ale, whence it proceedeth
that, since Candlemas, or his jigg of <i>John for the</i>
<i>King</i>, not one merry ditty will come from him; nothing
but <i>The Thunderbolt against Swearers</i>; <i>Repent,</i>
<i>England, Repent</i>, and the <i>Strange Judgments of God</i>."
Kemp, the comic actor and morris-dancer, was particularly
angry with the ballad-makers in general, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>
Deloney in particular, and addresses them in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Kemp's humble request to the impudent generation
of Ballad-makers and their coherents, that it
would please their rascalities to pitty his paines in
the great journey he pretends, and not fill the country
with lyes of his never done actes as they did in his
late <i>Morrice to Norwich</i>. I knowe the best of ye, by
the lyes ye writ of me, got not the price of a good hat
to cover your brainless heds. If any of ye had come
to me, my bounty should have exceeded the best of
your good masters the ballad-buiers. I wold have
apparrelled your dry pates in party-coloured bonnets,
and bestowed a leash of my cast belles to have crown'd
ye with cox-combs.</p>

<p>"I was told it was the great ballet-maker, T. D.,
alias Tho. Deloney, chronicler of the memorable lives
of the 6 yeamen of the West, Jack of Newbery, the
Gentle-Craft, and such like honest men, omitted by
Stow, Hollinshead, Grafton, Hal, Froysart, and the
rest of those wel deserving writers."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Richard Johnson, the author of the <i>Seven Champions</i>
<i>of Christendom</i>, like Deloney, collected his own
ballads into a book, and his <i>Crown Garland of Golden</i>
<i>Roses</i> was once highly popular.</p>

<p>Anthony Munday, a draper in Cripplegate, and a
member of the Drapers' Company, has the fame
of being a voluminous writer of ballads, but none of
his productions are known to exist. Kemp calls him
"Elderton's immediate heir," but he does not seem to
have walked in his predecessor's disreputable steps, but
to have lived respected to the good age of eighty. He
died Aug. 10, 1633, and was buried in St. Stephen's,
Coleman-street, where a monument with an inscription
in praise of his knowledge as an antiquary was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>erected. He wrote many of the annual city pageants,
besides plays, which caused Meres to call him "the
best plotter" of his age.</p>

<p>Chettle disguised Munday as Anthony Now-Now,
and Ben Jonson ridiculed him in <i>The Case is</i>
<i>Altered</i>, as Antonio Balladino, the pageant poet.
To the question, "You are not the pageant poet to
the city of Milan, are you?" he is made to answer,
"I supply the place, sir, when a worse cannot be
had, sir." He had several enemies who ran him
down, but he also had friends who stood up for him.
William Webbe, in his <i>Discourse of English Poetrie</i>,
describes Munday as "an earnest traveller in this
art," and says that he wrote "very excellent works,
especially upon nymphs and shepherds, well worthy
to be viewed and to be esteemed as rare poetry."</p>

<p>Thomas Middleton, the dramatic poet, who produced
the Lord Mayor's pageant for the mayoralty
of his namesake, Sir Thomas Middleton (<i>The</i>
<i>Triumphs of Truth</i>), in 1613, attacks poor Munday
most viciously. On the title-page he declares his
pageant to have been "directed, written, and redeem'd
into forme, from the ignorance of some
former times and their common writer," and in
his book he adds:&mdash;"The miserable want of both
[art and knowledge] which in the impudent common
writer hath often forced from me much pity
and sorrow, and it would heartily grieve any
understanding spirit to behold many times so
glorious a fire in bounty and goodness offering
to match itselfe with freezing art, sitting in darknesse
with the candle out, looking like the picture
of Blacke Monday."</p>

<p>When the civil war broke out, the majority of the
poets were ready to range themselves on the side of
the King. Alexander Brome was the most voluminous
writer of royalist songs, but Martin Parker, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>
writer of <i>The King shall enjoy his own again</i>,
must take rank as the leading ballad-writer of his
time. This was one of those songs that cheer the
supporters of a losing cause, and help them to win
success in the end. It is supposed to have formed
a by no means unimportant item in the causes that
brought about the Restoration. Parker is said to
have been the leading spirit in a society of ballad-writers;
he certainly was not the "Grub Street
scribbler" that Ritson has called him. The Puritans
hated this "ballad-maker laureat of London," and
lost no opportunity of denouncing him and his
works. Mr. Chappell has written an interesting
notice of him in his <i>Popular Music of the Olden</i>
<i>Time</i>, where he mentions some other royalist ballad
writers, as John Wade, the author of <i>The Royal</i>
<i>Oak</i>, Thomas Weaver, the author of a <i>Collection of</i>
<i>Songs</i>, in which he ridiculed the Puritans so effectually
that the book was denounced as a seditious
libel against the Government, and John Cleveland,
who, according to Anthony Wood, was the first to
come forth as a champion of the royal cause. The
last of these was one of the very few ballad writers
whose names are enrolled in the list of British poets.</p>

<p>In December, 1648, Captain Betham was appointed
Provost Marshal, with power to seize upon
all ballad-singers, and five years from that date
there were no more entries of ballads at Stationers'
Hall, but when Cromwell became Protector he removed
the ban against ballads and ballad-singers.
After the Restoration, the courtier poets wrote for
the streets, and therefore most of the ballads were
ranged on the side of the Court. After a time,
however, the Court fell into popular disfavour, and
it was then discovered that ballad-singers and
pamphleteers had too much liberty. Killigrew, the
Master of the Revels to Charles II., licensed all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[Pg xlii]</a></span>
singers and sellers of ballads, and John Clarke, a
London bookseller, rented of Killigrew this privilege
for a period, which expired in 1682. Besides
licensers of the singers and sellers, there were
licensers of the ballads themselves. These were
Sir Roger L'Estrange, from 1663 to 1685, Richard
Pocock, from 1685 to 1688, J. Fraser, from 1689 to
1691, and Edmund Bohun, who died in 1694, the
year that the licensing system also expired.</p>

<p>When James, Duke of York, went to Scotland to
seek for that popularity which he had lost in England,
he is supposed to have taken with him an
English ballad-maker to sing his praises, and this
man is believed to have produced <i>The Banishment</i>
<i>of Poverty by H. R. H. James, Duke of Albany</i>.
Ballad-singing was very much out of favour among
the authorities in the eighteenth century, and in
1716 the Middlesex grand jury denounced the singing
of "scandalous" ballads about the streets as a
common nuisance, tending to alienate the minds of
the people. In July, 1763, we are told that "yesterday
evening two women were sent to Bridewell
by Lord Bute's order for singing political ballads
before his lordship's door in South Audley Street."</p>

<p>Ballads were then pretty much the same kind of
rubbish that they are now, and there was little to
show that they once were excellent. The glorious
days when&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thespis, the first professor of our art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At country wakes sung ballads from a cart,"<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>had long ago departed. There are but few instances
of true poets writing for the streets in later times, but
we have one in Oliver Goldsmith. In his early life in
Dublin, when he often felt the want of a meal, he wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>ballads, which found a ready customer at five shillings
each at a little bookseller's shop in a by-street of
the city. We are informed that he was as sensitive
as to the reception of these children of his muse as
in after years he was of his more ambitious efforts;
and he used to stroll into the street to hear his
ballads sung, and to mark the degrees of applause
with which they were received. Most of the modern
ballad-writers have been local in their fame, as
Thomas Hoggart, the uncle of Hogarth the painter,
whose satiric lash made him a power in his native
district of Cumberland, dreaded alike by fools and
knaves.</p>

<p>The chief heroes of the older ballads were King
Arthur and his knights, Robin Hood, and Guy of
Warwick. The ballads relating to the first of these
appear to have been chiefly chipped off from the
great cycle of Arthurian romances. The popularity
of Robin Hood was at one time so great that Drayton
prophesied in his <i>Polyolbion</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In this our spacious isle I think there is not one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he hath heard some talk of him, and little John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the end of time the tales shall ne'er be done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Scarlock, George a Green, and Much the Miller's son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Tuck the merry Friar, which many a sermon made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In praise of Robin Hood, his outlaws, and their trade."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From a local hero he grew into national fame, and
superseded Arthur in popular regard. He then sunk
into a mere highwayman, to be again raised into
fame by literary men, Ritson being the chief of
these. Wakefield is still proud of its Pinder, who
was one of Robin Hood's company&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In Wakefield there lives a jolly Pinder;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Wakefield all on a green,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and one of the thoroughfares of that place is now
called Pinder Field Road. Robin Hood was a purely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>
English hero, but Guy of Warwick was almost as
popular in foreign countries as in his own land. The
earliest of English political ballads was an outcome
of the Barons' wars in the reign of Henry III.,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and
each period of political excitement since then has
been represented in ballads. The controversies
between Protestant and Papist were carried on in
verse, and Laud and his clergy were attacked by the
ballad-writers of the Puritan party.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Imitators and Forgers.</span></h3>

<p>No attempt was made to produce false antique
ballads until the true antiques had again risen in
public esteem, and one of the first to deceive the connoisseurs
was Lady Wardlaw, who was highly successful
in her object when she gave <i>Hardyknute</i> to the
world (see vol. ii. p. 105). She seems to have been
quite contented with the success which attended the
mystification, and does not appear to have taken any
particular pains to keep her secret close. Suspicions
were rife long before the publication of the <i>Reliques</i>,
but when they appeared the whole truth came out.
With regard to the other ballads, to which she had
added verses, there does not appear to have been
any attempt at concealment. The recent endeavour
to attribute a large number of the romantic ballads
of Scotland to her pen will be considered further on.</p>

<p>A large number of poets have imitated the old
ballad, but very few have been successful in the
attempt to give their efforts the genuine ring of the
original. Tickell and Goldsmith entered into the
spirit of their models, but Scott succeeded best in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>old Elspeth's fragment of a chant (the Battle of
Harlaw) in the <i>Antiquary</i>. W. J. Mickle, the translator
of the <i>Lusiad</i>, contributed several imitations
to Evans's <i>Collection of Old Ballads</i>, but although
these are beautiful poems in themselves, their claim to
antiquity was made to rest chiefly upon a distorted
spelling. One of the most remarkably successful
imitations of modern times is the ballad of <i>Trelawny</i>,
which the late Rev. R. S. Hawker, of Morwenstow,
wrote to suit the old burden of "And shall Trelawny
die." This spirited ballad deceived Scott, Macaulay,
and Dickens, who all believed it to be genuine, and
quoted it as such. In 1846 it was actually printed
by J. H. Dixon in his "Ancient Poems, Ballads, and
Songs of the Peasantry of England, taken down from
oral tradition, and transcribed from private manuscripts,
rare broadsides, and scarce publications,"
published by the Percy Society. Mr. Dixon was
probably deceived by Davies Gilbert, who sent the
ballad to the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> in 1827, and said
that it formerly "resounded in every house, in every
highway, and in every street." In 1832 Hawker had,
however, himself acknowledged the authorship. He
wrote in his <i>Records of the Western Shore</i> (p. 56),
"With the exception of the chorus contained in the
last two lines, this song was written by me in the
year 1825. It was soon after inserted in a Plymouth
paper. It happened to fall into the hands of Davies
Gilbert, Esq., who did me the honour to reprint it at
his private press at East Bourne, under the impression,
I believe, that it is an early composition of my
own. The two lines above-mentioned formed, I
believe, the burthen of the old song, and are all that
I can recover."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Hawker was fond of these mystifications,
and although he did not care to lose the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>credit of his productions, he was amused to see
another of his ballads, <i>Sir Beville</i>, find its way into
a collection of old ballads.</p>

<p>A far more beautiful ballad than <i>Hardyknute</i> is
<i>Auld Robin Gray</i>, in which a lady of rank caught
the spirit of the tender songs of peasant life with excellent
effect. Lady Anne Barnard kept her secret
for fifty years, and did not acknowledge herself the
author of it until 1823, when she disclosed the fact in
a letter to Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>These were harmless attempts to deceive, such as
will always be common among those who take a
pleasure in reducing the pride of the experts; and
when they were discovered no one was found to have
been injured by the deceit. It is far different,
however, when a forgery is foisted in among genuine
works, because when a discovery is made of its
untrustworthiness, the reputation of the true work is
injured by this association with the false. Pinkerton
inserted a large number of his own poems in his
edition of <i>Select Scottish Ballads</i> (1783), which poems
he alleged to be ancient. He was taken severely to
task by Ritson on account of these fabrications, and
he afterwards acknowledged his deceit.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>One of the most barefaced of literary deceptions
was the work published in 1810 by R. H. Cromek,
under the title of <i>Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway</i>
<i>Song</i>. Although the ballads contained in these
volumes are very varied in their subject, they were
almost entirely composed by Allan Cunningham,
who produced whatever was required of him by his
employer.</p>

<p>Poets are often the worst of editors, as they find
the temptation to "improve" their originals too
strong to resist. Allan Cunningham published in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>1826 a collection of the <i>Songs of Scotland</i>, in which
he availed himself so largely of this license that
Motherwell felt called upon to reprobate the work in
the strongest terms. He observes: "While thus
violating ancient song, he seems to have been well
aware of the heinousness of his offending. He might
shudder and sicken at his revolting task indeed! To
soothe his own alarmed conscience, and, if possible,
to reconcile the mind of his readers to his wholesale
mode of hacking and hewing and breaking the joints
of ancient and traditionary song; and to induce them
to receive with favour the conjectural emendations
it likes him to make, he, in the course of his progress,
not unfrequently chooses to sneer at those, and to
underrate their labours, who have used their best
endeavours to preserve ancient song in its primitive
and uncontaminated form."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> These are by no means
the hardest words used by Motherwell in respect to
the <i>Songs of Scotland</i>.</p>

<p>The worst among the forgers, however, was a man
who ought to have been above such dishonourable
work, viz., Robert Surtees, the author of the <i>History</i>
<i>of the County Palatine of Durham</i>, in whose
honour the Surtees Society was founded. In Scott's
<i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border</i> will be found three
ballads&mdash;<i>The Death of Featherstonhaugh</i>, <i>Lord Ewrie</i>,
and <i>Bartram's Dirge</i>, which are treated by Sir
Walter as true antiques, and of the genuine character
of which he never had a doubt. They are all three,
however, mere figments of Surtees's imagination.
Each of the ballads was accompanied by fictitious
historical incidents, to give it an extra appearance of
authenticity. <i>Featherstonhaugh</i> was said to be "taken
down from the recitation of a woman eighty years of
age, mother of one of the miners in Alston Moor;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span><i>Lord Ewrie</i> was obtained from "Rose Smith, of
Bishop Middleham, a woman aged upwards of ninety-one;"
and <i>Bartram's Dirge</i> from "Anne Douglas, an
old woman who weeded in his (Surtees's) garden."
On other occasions Sir Walter Scott was deluded by
his friend with false information. Mr. George Taylor
makes the following excuse in his <i>Life of Surtees</i>
(p. 25): "Mr. Surtees no doubt had wished to have
the success of his attempt tested by the unbiassed
opinion of the very first authority on the subject, and
the result must have been gratifying to him. But at
a later period of their intimacy, when personal regard
was added to high admiration for his correspondent,
he probably would not have subjected him to the
mortification of finding that he could be imposed on
in a matter where he had a right to consider himself
as almost infallible. And it was most likely from
this feeling that Mr. Surtees never acknowledged the
imposition: for so late as the year 1830, in which
Scott dates his introduction to the edition of the
<i>Minstrelsy</i>, published in 1831, the ballad of the <i>Death</i>
<i>of Featherstonhaugh</i> retains its place (vol. i. p. 240)
with the same expressions of obligation to Mr. Surtees
for the communication of it, and the same commendation
of his learned proofs of its authenticity."
In spite of this attempted justification, we cannot fail
to stigmatize Surtees's forgery as a crime against
letters which fouls the very wells of truth.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Authenticity of Certain Ballads</span></h3>

<p>As was to be expected, the existence of the forgeries
just referred to caused several persons to doubt
the genuineness of many of the true ballads. Finlay
wrote, in 1808, "the mention of <i>hats</i> and <i>cork-heeled</i>
<i>shoon</i> (in the ballad of <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i>) would lead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>
us to infer that some stanzas are interpolated, or that
its composition is of a comparatively modern date;"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
and, in 1839, the veteran ballad-collector, Mr. David
Laing, wrote as follows: "Notwithstanding the great
antiquity that has been claimed for <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i>,
one of the finest ballads in our language, very little
evidence would be required to persuade me but that
we were also indebted for it to Lady Wardlaw (<i>Stenhouse's</i>
<i>Illustrations of the Lyric Poetry and Music</i>
<i>of Scotland</i>, with additional notes to Johnson's <i>Scots</i>
<i>Musical Museum</i>, p. <a href="#Page_320">320</a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>)." At p. <a href="#Page_457">457</a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> of the same
book, Mr. Laing, after quoting from Finlay, made the
following further observations: "Bishop Percy also
remarks that 'an ingenious friend thinks the author
of <i>Hardyknute</i> has borrowed several expressions and
sentiments from the foregoing and other old Scottish
songs in this collection.' It was this resemblance
with the localities Dunfermline and Aberdour, in the
neighbourhood of Sir Henry Wardlaw's seat, that led
me to throw out the conjecture, whether this much-admired
ballad might not also have been written by
Lady Wardlaw herself, to whom the ballad of <i>Hardyknute</i>
is now universally attributed."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Mr. J. H. Dixon, in 1845, considered that the suspicion
had become a certainty, and wrote of Lady
Wardlaw as one "who certainly appears to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>a great adept at this species of literary imposture."
"This celebrated lady is <i>now known</i> to be the author
of <i>Edward! Edward!</i> and of <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i>, in
addition to <i>Hardyknute</i>."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Mr. Dixon and the late
Mr. Robert Chambers have also thrown out hints of
their disbelief in the authenticity of the recitations of
Mrs. Brown of Falkland.</p>

<p>These, however, were mere skirmishing attacks, but
in 1859 Robert Chambers marshalled his forces, and
made a decisive charge in his publication entitled <i>The</i>
<i>Romantic Scottish Ballads, their Epoch and Authorship</i>.
He there explains his belief as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Upon all these considerations I have arrived at
the conclusion that the high-class romantic ballads of
Scotland are not ancient compositions&mdash;are not older
than the early part of the eighteenth century&mdash;and
are mainly, if not wholly, the production of one mind.
Whose was this mind is a different question, on which
no such confident decision may, for the present, be
arrived at; but I have no hesitation in saying that,
from the internal resemblance traced on from <i>Hardyknute</i>
through <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i> and <i>Gil Morrice</i> to
the others, there seems to be a great likelihood that
the whole were the composition of the authoress of
that poem, namely, Elizabeth Lady Wardlaw of Pitreavie."</p>

<p>Scotsmen were not likely to sit down tamely
under an accusation by which their principal ballad
treasures were thus stigmatized as false gems, and
we find that several writers immediately took up their
pens to refute the calumny. It will be seen that the
charge is divided into two distinct parts, and it will
be well to avoid mixing them together, and to consider
each part separately.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[Pg li]</a></span></p>
<p>I. Certain ballads, generally supposed to be genuine,
were really written by one person, in imitation of
the antique.</p>

<p>II. The author of this deceit was Lady Wardlaw,
the writer of <i>Hardyknute</i>.</p>

<p>I. The ballads in the <i>Reliques</i>, which are instanced
by Chambers, are as follows:&mdash;</p>


<ol><li><i>Sir Patrick Spence.</i></li>
<li><i>Gil Morrice.</i></li>
<li><i>Edward! Edward!</i></li>
<li><i>Jew's Daughter.</i></li>
<li><i>Gilderoy.</i></li>
<li><i>Young Waters.</i></li>
<li><i>Edom o' Gordon.</i></li>
<li><i>Bonny Earl of Murray.</i></li>
</ol>

<p>Two of these (2 and 7) are in the Folio MS., which
was written before Lady Wardlaw was born; <i>Edom</i>
<i>o' Gordon</i> also exists in another old MS. copy; <i>Gilderoy</i>
(5) is known to have been a street ballad, and the
remainder are found in other copies. It is not necessary
to discuss each of these cases separately, and we
shall therefore reserve what we have to say for the
special consideration of <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i>.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, we must first consider how far
Chambers's previous knowledge of ballad literature
prepared him for this inquiry; and we cannot rate
that knowledge very highly, for in his <i>Collection of</i>
<i>Scottish Songs</i>, he actually attributes Wotton's <i>Ye</i>
<i>Meaner Beauties</i> to Darnley, and supposes Mary
Queen of Scots to have been the subject of the author's
praises. At this period also his scepticism had
not been aroused, for all the ballads that he thought
spurious in 1859 had been printed by him in 1829 as
genuine productions.</p>

<p>To return to the main Point at issue. Chambers
writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[Pg lii]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is now to be remarked of the ballads published
by the successors of Percy, as of those which he published,
that there is not a particle of positive evidence
for their having existed before the eighteenth century.
Overlooking the one given by Ramsay in his
<i>Tea-table Miscellany</i>, we have neither print nor manuscript
of them before the reign of George III. They
are not in the style of old literature. They contain
no references to old literature. As little does old
literature contain any references to them. They
wholly escaped the collecting diligence of Bannatyne.
James Watson, who published a collection of
Scottish poetry in 1706-1711, wholly overlooks them.
Ramsay, as we see, caught up only one."</p>

<p>Mr. Norval Clyne (<i>Ballads from Scottish History</i>,
1863, p. 217) gives a satisfactory answer to the
above. He writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The want of any ancient manuscript can be no
argument against the antiquity of a poem, versions
of which have been obtained from oral recitation,
otherwise the great mass of ballads of all kinds collected
by Scott, and by others since his time, must
lie under equal suspicion. Bannatyne, in the sixteenth
century, and Allan Ramsay, in the early part of the
eighteenth, were not collectors of popular poetry in
the same sense as those who have since been so
active in that field. The former contented himself,
for the most part, with transcribing the compositions
of Dunbar, Henrysone, and other "makers," well
known by name, and Ramsay took the bulk of his
<i>Evergreen</i> from Bannatyne's MS. That a great
many poems of the ballad class, afterwards collected
and printed, must have been current among the people
when the <i>Evergreen</i> was published, no one that knows
anything of the subject will deny." The old ballads
lived on the tongues of the people, and a small percentage
of them only were ever committed to writing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[Pg liii]</a></span>
so that a fairer test of authenticity is the existence of
various versions. Of known forgeries no varieties
exist, but several versions of <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i> have
been rescued from oblivion.</p>

<p>It is not probable that any fresh ballads will be
obtained from recitation, but it is in some degree possible,
as may be seen from an instance of a kindred
nature in the field of language. We know that local
dialects have almost passed away, and yet some of
the glossaries of them lately issued contain words that
explain otherwise dark passages in manuscripts of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Chambers further affirms that the sentiment of
these ballads is not congenial to that of the peasantry&mdash;"it
may be allowably said, there is a tone of <i>breeding</i>
throughout these ballads, such as is never found in
the productions of rustic genius." This, however, is
begging the question, for it does not follow that the
songs of the peasantry were written by the peasantry.
It is they who have remembered them, and held to
them with greater tenacity than the educated classes.</p>

<p>We now come to the text that bears specially upon
<i>Sir Patrick Spence</i>, and we will give it in Chambers's
own words:&mdash;"The Scottish ladies sit bewailing the
loss of Sir Patrick Spence's companions 'wi' the
gowd kaims in their hair.' Sir Patrick tells his friends
before starting on his voyage, 'Our ship must sail the
faem;'<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and in the description of the consequences of
his shipwreck, we find 'Mony was the feather-bed
that flattered on the faem.'<a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> No old poet would use
<i>faem</i> as an equivalent for the sea; but it was just
such a phrase as a poet of the era of Pope would
use in that sense." In the first place, we
should be justified in saying that this test is not a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[Pg liv]</a></span>fair one, because no one will contend that the ballads
have not been altered in passing from hand to hand,
and new words inserted; but Mr. Norval Clyne has
a complete answer for this particular objection; he
writes: "Bishop Gawin Douglas completed his translation
of Virgil's &AElig;neid on 22nd July, 1513, and in
his Prologue to the twelfth book are these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Some sang ring-sangs, dancis, ledis, roundis,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With vocis schil, quhil all the dale resounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quhareto they walk into their karoling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For amourous layis dois all the rochis ring:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ane sang 'The schip salis over the salt fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will bring thir merchandis and my lemane hame.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here we have the expression, to which attention is
called, occurring in a popular song in common use
before the battle of Flodden. I have seen it remarked,
however, that it is the elliptical use of 'sail
the faem' for 'sail over the faem,' which indicates
an authorship not older than the day of Queen Anne.
My answer to this objection shall also be an example
from an 'old poet.' One of the <i>Tales of the</i>
<i>Three Priests of Peblis</i> assigned to the early part
of the sixteenth century, describes in homely verse
the career of a thrifty burgess, and contains these
lines (<i>Sibbald's Chronicle of Scottish Poetry</i>, 1802):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Then bocht he wool, and wyselie couth it wey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And efter that sone saylit he the sey.'"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These quotations completely set aside one portion
of the charge, and the other, in which an attempt is
made to show that a similar form of expression is
constantly occurring in the several poems, is really of
little weight, pressed as it is with some unfairness.
We have already seen that the old minstrels used
certain forms of expression as helps to memory, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[Pg lv]</a></span>these recur in ballads that have little or no connection
with each other. Chambers, following David Laing,
uses Percy's note at the end of <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
as an engine of attack against the authenticity of
the ballad, but there is really no reason for the conclusion
he comes to, "that the parity he remarked in
the expressions was simply owing to the two ballads
being the production of one mind," for a copyist well
acquainted with ballad literature would naturally adopt
the expressions found in them in his own composition.</p>

<p>II. The consideration of the opinion that Lady
Wardlaw was the author of <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i> and
other ballads, need not detain us long, because the
main point of interest is their authenticity, and the
question of her authorship is quite a secondary
matter: that falls to the ground if the grand charge
is proved false, and need not stand even if that
remains unrefuted. The only reason for fixing
upon Lady Wardlaw appears to have been that
as these ballads were transmitted to Percy by Lord
Hailes, and one of them was an imitation of the
antique by Lady Wardlaw, and another was added
to by the same lady, therefore if a similarity between
the ballads could be proved, it would follow that all
were written by her. Now the very fact that the
authorship of <i>Hardyknute</i> was soon discovered is
strong evidence against any such supposition, because
none of her associates had any suspicion that she had
counterfeited other ballads, and could such a wholesale
manufacture have been concealed for a century
it would be a greater mystery than the vexed question,
who was Junius? The other point, whether
the author of the indistinct and redundant <i>Hardyknute</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[Pg lvi]</a></span>could have written the clear and incisive lines
of <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i> may be left to be decided by
readers who have the two poems before them in
these volumes.</p>

<p>A few particulars may, however, be mentioned.
The openings of these ballads form excellent contrasted
examples of the two different styles of ballad
writing. <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i> commences at once, like
other minstrel ballads, with the description of the
king and his council:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The king sits in Dumferling toune,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Drinking the blude-reid wine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O quhar will I get guid sail&ograve;r<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To sail this schip of mine?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Up and spak an eldern knicht,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sat at the kings richt kne:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sir Patrick Spence is the best sail&ograve;r,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That sails upon the se."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The king then sends a letter to Spence. There is
no description of how this was sent, but we at once
read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The first line that Sir Patrick red,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A loud lauch lauched he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next line that Sir Patrick red,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The teir blinded his ee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Hardyknute</i>, on the other hand, is full of reasons
and illustrative instances in the true ballad-writer's
style:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Stately stept he east the wa',<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And stately stept he west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full seventy years he now had seen<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wi' scarce seven years of rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He liv'd when Britons breach of faith<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wrought Scotland mickle wae:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ay his sword tauld to their cost,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He was their deadlye fae."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Having placed the openings of the two poems
in opposition, we will do the same with the endings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[Pg lvii]</a></span>
How different is the grand finish of <i>Sir Patrick</i>
<i>Spence</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Have owre, have owre to Aberdour,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It's fiftie fadom deip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thair lies guid Sir Patrick Spence,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wi' the Scots lords at his feit."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>from the feeble conclusion of <i>Hardyknute</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'As fast I've sped owre Scotlands faes,'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There ceas'd his brag of weir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sair sham'd to mind ought but his dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And maiden fairly fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black fear he felt, but what to fear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He wist nae yet; wi' dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sai shook his body, sair his limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And a' the warrior fled."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Sir Patrick Spence</i> gives us a clear picture that a
painter could easily reproduce, but <i>Hardyknute</i> is so
vague that it is sometimes difficult to follow it with
understanding, and if the same author wrote them
both she must have been so strangely versatile in
her talents that there is no difficulty in believing
that she wrote all the romantic ballads of Scotland.</p>

<p>How little Chambers can be trusted may be seen
in the following passage, where he writes: "The first
hint at the real author came out through Percy, who
in his second edition of the <i>Reliques</i> (1767) gives the
following statement, 'There is more than reason,'
&amp;c.,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> to which he adds the note: 'It is rather remarkable
that Percy was not informed of these particulars
in 1765; but in 1767, <i>Sir John Hope Bruce having</i>
<i>died in the interval</i> (June, 1766), they were communicated
to him. It looks as if the secret had hung on
the life of this venerable gentleman." Who would
suspect, what is the real fact of the case, that Percy's
quoted preface was actually printed in his first edition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[Pg lviii]</a></span>(1765), and that Chambers's remarks fall to the
ground because they are founded on a gross blunder.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Preservers of the Ballads.</span></h3>

<p>Printed broadsides are peculiarly liable to accidents
which shorten their existence, and we therefore owe
much to the collectors who have saved some few of
them from destruction. Ballads were usually pasted
on their walls by the cottagers, but they were sometimes
collected together in bundles. Motherwell had
"heard it as a by-word in some parts of Stirlingshire
that a collier's library consists but of four
books, the Confession of Faith, the Bible, a bundle
of Ballads, and Sir William Wallace. The first for
the gudewife, the second for the gudeman, the third
for their daughter, and the last for the son, a selection
indicative of no mean taste in these grim mold-warps
of humanity."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The love of a good ballad has, however, never
been confined to the uneducated. Queen Mary II.,
after listening to the compositions of Purcell, played
by the composer himself, asked Mrs. Arabella Hunt
to sing Tom D'Urfey's ballad of "Cold and Raw,"
which was set to a good old tune, and thereby
offended Purcell's vanity, who was left unemployed
at the harpsichord. Nevertheless, the composer had
the sense afterwards to introduce the tune as the bass
of a song he wrote himself. When ballads were intended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[Pg lix]</a></span>for the exclusive use of the ordinary ballad-buyers
they were printed in black letter, a type that
was retained for this purpose for more than a century
after it had gone out of use for other purposes.
According to Pepys the use of black letter ceased
about the year 1700, and on the title-page of his
collection he has written "the whole continued
down to the year 1700, when the form till then
peculiar thereto, viz. of the black letter with pictures,
seems (for cheapness sake) wholly laid aside for that
of the white letter without pictures." White-letter
printing of non-political street ballads really commenced
about 1685, and of political ballads about
half a century earlier. The saving referred to by
Pepys as being made by the omission of woodcuts
could not have been great, for they seldom illustrated
the letterpress, and were used over and over again,
so that cuts which were executed in the reign of
James I. were used on ballads in Queen Anne's time.</p>

<p>Until about the year 1712 ballads were universally
printed on broadsides, and those intended to be sold
in the streets are still so printed, but after that date
such as were intended to be vended about the country
were printed so as to fold into book form.</p>

<p>The great ballad factory has been for many years
situated in Seven Dials, where Pitts employed Corcoran
and was the patron of "slender Ben," "over
head and ears Nic," and other equally respectably
named poets. The renowned Catnach lived in
Seven Dials, and left a considerable business at his
death. He was the first to print yards of songs for
a penny, and his fame was so extended, that his
name has come to be used for a special class of
literature.</p>

<p>Although, thanks to the labours of far-sighted
men, our stock of old ballads and songs is large, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lx" id="Page_lx">[Pg lx]</a></span>
know that those which are irrevocably lost far
exceed them in number. It is therefore something
to recover even the titles of some of these, and we
can do this to a considerable extent by seeking
them in some of the old specimens of literature. In
<i>Cockelbie's Sow</i>, a piece written about 1450, which
was printed in Laing's <i>Select Remains of the Ancient</i>
<i>Popular Poetry of Scotland</i> (Edinburgh, 1822), there
is a list of the songs sung at a meeting. In Henryson's
curious old pastoral, <i>Robin and Makyne</i> (vol.
2, p. 85), reference is made to the popular tales and
songs, which were even then old:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Robin, thou hast heard sung and say,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In gests and storys auld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The man that will not when he may<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sall hav nocht when he wald.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To the prologues of Gawin Douglas's translation
of Virgil's <i>&AElig;neid</i>, we are indebted for a knowledge
of four old songs, a fact that outweighs in the
opinion of some the merits of the work itself, which
was the first translation of a classic that ever appeared
in England.</p>

<p>In the Catalogue of Captain Cox's Library, printed
in Laneham's letter on the Kenilworth entertainments,
there is a short list of some of the popular
ballads of his time, but it is sorely tantalizing to read
of "a bunch of ballets and songs all auncient," "and
a hundred more he hath fair wrapt in parchment,
and bound with a whipcord." We learn the names
of ballads which were popular in old Scotland from
the <i>Complaynt of Scotland</i>, a most interesting list,
which Mr. Furnivall has fully illustrated and explained
in his edition of Laneham. Another source
of information for learning the names of songs no
longer known to exist are the medleys, which are
made up of the first lines of many songs. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[Pg lxi]</a></span>
extreme popularity of ballads in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries is reflected in the literature of
the time, which is full of allusions to them. Burton,
the anatomist of melancholy, who put a little of
almost everything into his book, could not be expected
to overlook ballads. He says: "The very
rusticks and hog-rubbers ... have their wakes,
whitson ales, shepherds' feasts, meetings on holy
dayes, countrey dances, roundelayes ... instead of
odes, epigrams and elegies, &amp;c., they have their
ballads, countrey tunes, <i>O the Broom, the bonny,</i>
<i>bonny Broom</i>, ditties and songs, <i>Bess a Bell she doth</i>
<i>excel</i>." The favourite songs of Father Rosin, the
minstrel in Ben Jonson's <i>Tale of a Tub</i> (act i.
sc. 2), are <i>Tom Tiler</i>, the <i>Jolly Joiner</i>, and the
<i>Jovial Tinker</i>. The old drama is full of these
references, and one of the most frequent modes of
revenge against an enemy was to threaten that he
should be <i>balladed</i>. Thus Massinger writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i11">"I will have thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pictur'd as thou art now, and thy whole story<br /></span>

<p>Fletcher sets side by side as equal evils the having
one's eyes dug out, and the having one's name sung</p>

</div></div>

<p>The ballad-writers are called base rogues, and said
to "maintaine a St. Anthonie's fire in their noses
by nothing but two-penny ale."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Shakspere was not behind his contemporaries in
his contemptuous treatment of "odious ballads," or
of "these same metre ballad-mongers," but he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[Pg lxii]</a></span>shown by the references in <i>King Lear</i> and <i>Hamlet</i>
his high appreciation of the genuine old work, and
there is no doubt that the creator of Autolycus loved
"a ballad but even too well."</p>

<p>There have been two kinds of collectors, viz.
those who copied such fugitive poetry as came in
their way, and those who bought up all the printed
ballads they could obtain.</p>

<p>Of the manuscript collections of old poetry, the
three most celebrated are the Maitland MS. in the
Pepysian Library, Cambridge, the Bannatyne MS.
presented by the Earl of Hyndford to the Advocates'
Library, Edinburgh, and the famous folio
MS. which formerly belonged to Percy, and is now
in the British Museum. The Maitland MS., which
contains an excellent collection of Scotch poetry,
was formed by Sir Richard Maitland, of Lethington,
Lord Privy Seal and Judge in the Court of Session
(b. 1496, d. 1586). Selections from this MS. were
printed by Pinkerton in 1786.</p>

<p>In the year 1568, when Scotland was visited by
the Plague, a certain George Bannatyne, of whom
nothing is known, retired to his house to escape infection,
and employed his leisure in compiling his
most valuable collection of Scottish poetry. This
MS. was lent out of the Advocates' Library to
Percy, and he was allowed to keep it for a considerable
time. Sir David Dalrymple published
"Some ancient Scottish Poems" in 1770, which were
taken from this MS.</p>

<p>The great Lord Burghley was one of the first
to recognize the value of ballads as an evidence of
the popular feeling, and he ordered all broadsides
to be brought to him as they were published. The
learned Selden was also a collector of them, but the
Chinese nation was before these wise men, and had
realized an idea that has often been suggested in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[Pg lxiii]</a></span>
Europe. One of their sacred books is the <i>Book of</i>
<i>Songs</i>, in which the manners of the country are
illustrated by songs and odes, the most popular of
which were brought to the sovereign for the purpose.</p>

<p>The largest collections of printed ballads are now
in Magdalene College, Cambridge, in the Bodleian
at Oxford, and in the British Museum. Some smaller
collections are in private hands. In taking stock of
these collections, we are greatly helped by Mr.
Chappell's interesting preface to the <i>Roxburghe</i>
<i>Ballads</i>. The Pepysian collection deposited in
the library of Magdalene College, Cambridge, consisting
of 1,800 ballads in five vols., is one of the
oldest and most valuable of the collections. It was
commenced by Selden, who died in 1654, and continued
by Samuel Pepys till near the time of his
own death in 1703. Tradition reports that Pepys
borrowed Selden's collection, and then "forgot" to
return it to the proper owner. Besides these five
volumes, there are three vols. of what Pepys calls
penny merriments. There are 112 of these, and
some are garlands that contain many ballads in each.</p>

<p>Cambridge's rival, Oxford, possesses three collections,
viz. Anthony Wood's 279 ballads and collection
of garlands, Francis Douce's 877 in four vols.,
and Richard Rawlinson's 218.</p>

<p>Previously to the year 1845, when the Roxburghe
collection was purchased, there were in the British
Museum Library about 1,000 ballads, but Mr. Chappell,
without counting the <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i>, gives
the number as 1292 in 1864. They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The celebrated Roxburghe collection was bought
by Rodd at Benjamin Heywood Bright's sale in
1845 for the British Museum, the price being <i>&pound;</i>535.
It was originally formed by Robert Harley, first
Earl of Oxford, and as John Bagford was one of the
buyers employed by the Earl, he is the reputed collector
of the ballads. At the sale of the Harleian
Library, this collection became the property of
James West, P.R.S., and when his books were sold
in 1773, Major Thomas Pearson bought it for, it is
said, <i>&pound;</i>20. This gentleman, with the assistance of
Isaac Reed, added to the collection, and bound it in
two volumes with printed title-pages, indexes, &amp;c.
In 1788, John, Duke of Roxburghe, bought it at
Major Pearson's sale for <i>&pound;</i>36 14<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and afterwards
added largely to it, making a third volume. At the
Duke's sale in 1813, the three volumes were bought
for <i>&pound;</i>477 15<i>s.</i>, by Harding, who sold them to Mr.
Bright for, it is supposed, <i>&pound;</i>700. The collection
consists of 1335 broadsides, printed between 1567
and the end of the eighteenth century, two-thirds of
them being in black letter. Bright added a fourth
volume of eighty-five pages, which was bought for
the British Museum for <i>&pound;</i>25 5<i>s.</i></p>

<p>Some early ballads are included in the collection
of broadsides in the library of the Society of Antiquaries,
and a collection of proclamations and ballads
was made by Mr. Halliwell Phillipps, and presented
by him to the Chetham Library at Manchester.</p>

<p>The late George Daniel picked up a valuable
collection of ballads at an old shop in Ipswich, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[Pg lxv]</a></span>
is supposed to have come from Helmingham Hall,
Suffolk, where it had lain unnoticed or forgotten for
two centuries or more. It originally numbered 175
to 200 ballads, but was divided by Daniel, who sold
one portion (consisting of eighty-eight ballads) to
Thorpe, who disposed of it to Heber. At Heber's
sale it was bought by Mr. W. H. Miller, of Britwell,
and from him it descended to Mr. S. Christie Miller.
Twenty-five ballads known to have belonged to the
same collection were edited by Mr. Payne Collier for
the Percy Society in 1840. The portion that Daniel
retained was bought at the sale of his library by Mr.
Henry Huth, who has reprinted seventy-nine of the
best ballads. Other known private collections are
five volumes belonging to Mr. Frederic Ouvry, President
of the Society of Antiquaries, which contain
Mr. Payne Collier's collection of Black-letter Ballads,
the Earl of Jersey's at Osterley Park, and one which
was formed by Mr. Halliwell Phillipps, who printed
a full catalogue of the ballads contained in it, and
then disposed of it to the late Mr. William Euing of
Glasgow.</p>

<p>We owe our gratitude to all these collectors, but
must also do honour to those writers who in advance
of their age tried to lead their contemporaries to fresher
springs than those to which they were accustomed.
The first of these was Addison, who commented on
the beauties of <i>Chevy Chase</i> and the <i>Children in the</i>
<i>Wood</i> in the <i>Spectator</i>. He wrote: "it is impossible
that anything should be universally tasted and approved
by a multitude, though they are only the
rabble of a nation, which hath not in it some peculiar
aptness to please and gratify the mind of man."</p>

<p>Rowe was another appreciator of this popular
literature, and his example and teaching may have
had its influence in the publication of the first <i>Collection</i>
<i>of Old Ballads</i>, for the motto to the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[Pg lxvi]</a></span>
volume is taken from the prologue to Rowe's <i>Jane</i>
<i>Shore</i> (first acted in 1713):&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let no nice sir despise the hapless dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because recording ballads chaunt her name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those venerable ancient song enditers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soar'd many a pitch above our modern writers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They caterwauled in no romantic ditty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sighing for Philis's or Cloe's pity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Justly they drew the Fair and spoke her plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sung her by her Christian name&mdash;'twas Jane.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our numbers may be more refined than those,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what we've gain'd in verse, we've lost in prose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their words no shuffling double meaning knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their speech was homely, but their hearts were true."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Parnell, Tickell, and Prior belonged to the small
band who had the taste to appreciate the unfashionable
old ballad. Prior says of himself in a MS.
essay quoted by Disraeli in the <i>Calamities of Authors</i>:
"I remember nothing further in life than that I made
verses: I chose Guy Earl of Warwick for my first
hero, and killed Colborne the giant before I was big
enough for Westminster school." The few were,
however, unable to convert the many, and Dr. Wagstaffe,
one of the wits of the day, ridiculed Addison
for his good taste, and in a parody of the famous
essay on <i>Chevy Chase</i> he commented upon the
<i>History of Tom Thumb</i>, and pretended to point
out the congenial spirit of this poet with Virgil.</p>

<p>There is still another class of preservers of ballads
to be mentioned, viz. those whose tenacious memories
allow them to retain the legends and songs they heard
in their youth, but as Prof. Aytoun writes: "No Elspats
of the Craigburnfoot remain to repeat to grandchildren
that legendary lore which they had acquired
in years long gone by from the last of the itinerant
minstrels." The most celebrated of these retailers
of the old ballads was Mrs. Brown of Falkland, wife
of the Rev. Dr. Brown, for from her both Scott and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[Pg lxvii]</a></span>
Jamieson obtained some of their best pieces. Her
taste for the songs and tales of chivalry was derived
from an aunt, Mrs. Farquhar, "who was married to
the proprietor of a small estate near the sources of
the Dee in Braemar, a good old woman, who spent
the best part of her life among flocks and herds, [but]
resided in her latter years in the town of Aberdeen.
She was possest of a most tenacious memory, which
retained all the songs she had heard from nurses
and countrywomen in that sequestered part of the
country."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Doubts have been expressed as to the
good faith of Mrs. Brown, but they do not appear to
be well grounded. Another of these ladies from
whose mouths we have learnt so much of the ever-fading
relics of the people's literature was Mrs. Arrot.</p>

<p>The earliest printed collection of Scottish popular
poetry known to exist is a volume printed at Edinburgh,
"by Walter Chepman and Androw Myllar, in
the year 1508," which was reprinted in facsimile
by David Laing in 1827. The next work of interest
in the bibliography of ballads is "Ane Compendious
Booke of Godly and Spirituall Songs, collected
out of sundrie partes of the Scripture, with
sundrie of other ballates, chainged out of prophaine
songs for avoiding of Sinne and Harlotrie," printed
in 1590 and 1621, and reprinted by J. G. Dalzell in
1801, and by David Laing in 1868. It contains
parodies of some of the songs mentioned in the <i>Complaint</i>
<i>of Scotland</i>, and is supposed to be the work of
three brothers&mdash;James, John, and Robert Wedderburn,
of Dundee. To the last of the three Mr.
Laing attributed the <i>Complaint</i>, but Mr. Murray, the
latest editor of that book, is unable to agree with him.</p>

<p>The first book of "prophane" songs published in
Scotland was a musical collection entitled "Cantus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[Pg lxviii]</a></span>Songs and Fancies to several musicall parts, both apt
for voices and viols: with a brief introduction to
musick, as it is taught by Thomas Davidson in the
Musick School of Aberdeen. Aberdeen, printed by
John Forbes." 1662, 1666, and 1682.</p>

<p>The next work in order of time is "A Choise Collection
of Comic and Serious Scots Poems, both
ancient and modern, by several hands. Edinburgh,
printed by James Watson." In three parts, 1706,
1709, 1710. Supposed to have been compiled by
John Spottiswood, author of <i>Hope's Minor Practicks</i>.</p>

<p>All these works emanated from Scotchmen, and
the only works of the same character that were
published in England were small collections of songs and
ballads, called Garlands and Drolleries. These are
too numerous to be noticed here; but that they were
highly popular may be judged from the fact that a
thirteenth edition of <i>The Golden Garland of Princely</i>
<i>Delight</i> is registered. The Garlands are chiefly small
collections of songs on similar subjects. Thus, there
were Love's Garlands, Loyal Garlands, Protestant
Garlands, &amp;c. Considerable pains seem to have been
taken in order to obtain attractive titles for these little
brochures. Thus, on one we read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sweet and the sower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nettle and the flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thorne and the rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This garland compose."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Drolleries were collections of "jovial poems" and
"merry songs," and some of them were confined to
the songs sung at the theatres.</p>

<p>One of the first English collections of any pretensions
was Dryden's <i>Miscellany Poems</i>, published in
1684-1708, which was shortly after followed by Tom
D'Urfey's <i>Wit and Mirth, or Pills to Purge Melancholy</i>,
1719-20. But the first attempt to bring together
a large number of popular ballads, as distin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[Pg lxix]</a></span>guished
from songs, was made in "A Collection of
Old Ballads, corrected from the best and most ancient
copies extant, with Introductions historical, critical,
or humorous." London. Vols I. and II. 1723. Vol.
III. 1725.</p>

<p>The object of most of the works referred to above
was the publication of songs to be sung; the object of
this one was the presentment of ballads to be read.
It had a large sale, and the editor (who is said to have
been Ambrose Phillips) expresses his satisfaction in
the Preface to Vol. II.: "Though we printed a large
edition for such a trifle, and in less than two months
put it to the press again, yet could we not get our
second edition out before it was really wanted." In
spite, however, of its satisfactory reception, it does
not appear to have taken any permanent position in
literature, although it must have prepared the public
mind to receive the <i>Reliques</i>. This collection contains
one hundred and fifty-nine ballads, out of which
number twenty-three are also in the <i>Reliques</i>.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Many
of the others are of considerable interest, but some
had better have been left unprinted, and all are of little
critical value.</p>

<p>In the year after the first two volumes of the English
collection were published, Allan Ramsay issued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[Pg lxx]</a></span>in Edinburgh "The Evergreen, being a collection of
Scots poems wrote by the ingenious before 1600,"
the principal materials of which were derived from
the Bannatyne MS. This was followed in the same
year (1724) by "The Tea-Table Miscellany: a Collection
of choice Songs, Scots and English," a work
which is frequently referred to by Percy in the following
pages. In neither of these works was Ramsay
very particular as to the liberties he allowed himself
in altering his originals. In order to make the volumes
fit reading for his audience, which he hoped would
consist of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ilka lovely British lass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Frae ladies Charlotte, Ann, and Jean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to ilk bonnie singing lass<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wha dances barefoot on the green,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Ramsay pruned the songs of their indelicacies, and
filled up the gaps thus made in his own way. The
<i>Tea-table Miscellany</i> contains upwards of twenty presumably
old songs, upwards of twelve old songs much
altered, and about one hundred songs written by the
editor himself, Crawford, Hamilton, and others.</p>

<p>In 1725, William Thomson, a teacher of music in
London, brought out a collection of Scottish songs,
which he had chiefly taken from the <i>Tea-table Miscellany</i>
without acknowledgment. He called his book
<i>Orpheus Caledonius</i>.</p>

<p>For some years before Percy's collection appeared,
the Foulises, Glasgow's celebrated printers, issued
from their press, under the superintendence of Lord
Hailes, various Scottish ballads, luxuriously printed
with large type, in a small quarto size.</p>

<p>These were the signs that might have shown the
far-sighted man that a revival was at hand. At last
the time came when, tired out with the dreary and
leaden regularity of the verse-writers of the day, the
people were ready to receive poetry fresh from na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[Pg lxxi]</a></span>ture.
The man who arose to supply the want (which
was none the less a want that it was an unrecognized
one) was Thomas Percy, a clergyman living in a retired
part of the country, but occasionally seen among
the <i>literati</i> of the capital.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Life of Percy.</span></h3>

<p>Thomas Percy was born on April 13th, 1729, at
Bridgnorth in Shropshire, in a street called the
Cartway. His father and grandfather were grocers,
spelt their name Piercy, and knew nothing of any
connection with the noble house of Northumberland.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
His early education was received at the
grammar school of Bridgnorth, and in 1746, being then
in his eighteenth year, and having obtained an exhibition,
he matriculated as a commoner at Christ
Church, Oxford.</p>

<p>He took the degree of B.A. on May 2nd, 1750,
that of M.A. on July 5th, 1753, and shortly after
was presented by his college to the living of Easton
Maudit, in the county of Northampton. In this
poor cure he remained for twenty-five years, and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[Pg lxxii]</a></span>the little vicarage his six children (Anne, Barbara,
Henry, Elizabeth, Charlotte, and Hester), were all
born. Percy's income was increased in 1756 by the
gift of the rectory of Wilby, an adjacent parish, in
the patronage of the Earl of Sussex, and on April
24th, 1759, he married Anne, daughter of Barton
Gutteridge,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> who was his beloved companion for
forty-seven years. It was to this lady, before his
marriage to her, that Percy wrote his famous song,
"O Nancy, wilt thou go with me?" Miss Matilda
L&aelig;titia Hawkins stated in her <i>Memoirs</i>, that these
charming verses were intended by Percy as a welcome
to his wife on her release from a twelve-month's
confinement in the royal nursery, and Mr.
Pickford follows her authority in his <i>Life of Percy</i>,
but this is an entire mistake, for the song was printed
as early as the year 1758 in the sixth volume of Dodsley's
<i>Collection of Poems</i>. Anyone who reads the
following verses will see, that though appropriate as
a lover's proposal, they are very inappropriate as a
husband's welcome home to his wife.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Nancy, wilt thou go with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor sigh to leave the flaunting town?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No longer drest in silken sheen,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No longer deck'd with jewels rare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, canst thou quit each courtly scene,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Nancy, when thou'rt far away,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Nor shrink before the wintry wind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, can that soft and gentle mien<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Extremes of hardship learn to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, sad, regret each courtly scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where thou wert fairest of the fair?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or, when thy swain mishap shall rue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To share with him the pang of woe?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, should disease or pain befall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wilt thou assume the nurse's care?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wistful, those gay scenes recall,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where thou wert fairest of the fair?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And when at last thy love shall die,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wilt thou receive his parting breath?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou repress each struggling sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And cheer with smiles the bed of death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wilt thou o'er his breathless clay<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Strew flowers, and drop the tender tear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor then regret those scenes so gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where thou wert fairest of the fair?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>By the alteration of a few words, such as <i>gang</i> for
<i>go</i>, <i>toun</i> for <i>town</i>, &amp;c., "Oh Nanny, wilt thou gang
with me?" was transposed into a Scotch song, and
printed as such in Johnson's <i>Musical Museum</i>.
Burns remarked on this insertion: "It is too barefaced
to take Dr. Percy's charming song, and by
the means of transposing a few English words into
Scots, to offer it to pass for a Scots song. I was
not acquainted with the editor until the first volume
was nearly finished, else had I known in time I
would have prevented such an impudent absurdity."
Stenhouse, suggested<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> that Percy may have had
in view the song called <i>The young Laird and Edinburgh</i>
<i>Kate</i>, printed in Ramsay's <i>Tea-Table Miscellany</i>,
the second stanza of which is somewhat
similar&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Katy, wiltu gang wi' me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave the dinsome town awhile?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blossom's sprouting from the tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a' the simmer's gawn to smile."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[Pg lxxiv]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe, however, hinted<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
that "perhaps both the author of <i>The Young Laird</i>
<i>and Edinburgh Katy</i>, and the Bishop, took the idea
of their ballads from a song in Lee's beautiful
tragedy of <i>Theodosius, or the Force of Love</i>."</p>

<p>Dr. Rimbault communicated this poem to the
editors of the folio MS. from a MS. dated 1682, or
fifteen years earlier than Lee's version. It is called
<i>The Royal Nun</i>, and the first stanza is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Canst thou, Marina, leave the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The world that is devotion's bane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where crowns are toss'd and sceptres hurl'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where lust and proud ambition reign?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou thy costly robes forbear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To live with us in poor attire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Canst thou from courts to cells repair<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To sing at midnight in the quire?"<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The likeness in this stanza to Percy's song is not
very apparent, and the subject is very different.
The other three stanzas have nothing in common
with <i>O Nancy</i>. Even could it be proved that
Percy had borrowed the opening idea from these
two poems, it does not derogate from his originality,
for the charm of the song is all his own.</p>

<p>A portrait of Mrs. Percy holding in her hand a
scroll inscribed <i>Oh Nancy</i>, is preserved at Ecton
House, near Northampton, the seat of Mr. Samuel
Isted, husband of Percy's daughter Barbara.</p>

<p>The song was set to music by Thomas Carter,
and sung by Vernon at Vauxhall in 1773.</p>

<p>In 1761 Percy commenced his literary career by
the publication of a Chinese novel, <i>Hau Kiau Chooan</i>,
in four volumes, which he translated from the Portuguese,
and in the same year he undertook to edit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[Pg lxxv]</a></span>the works of the Duke of Buckingham. In 1762
he published "Miscellaneous Pieces relating to the
Chinese," and in 1763 commenced a new edition of
Surrey's Poems, with a selection of early specimens
of blank verse. The "Buckingham" and "Surrey"
were printed, but never published, and the stock of
the latter was destroyed by fire in 1808. In 1763
were published "Five Pieces of Runic Poetry&mdash;translated
from the Icelandic Language," and in
the following year appeared "A New Translation
of the Song of Solomon from the Hebrew, with
Commentary and Notes," and also "A Key to the
New Testament." Dr. Johnson paid a long-promised
visit to the Vicarage of Easton Maudit in the
summer of 1764, where he stayed for some months,
and the little terrace in the garden is still called after
him, "Dr. Johnson's Walk." At this time Percy
must have been full of anxiety about his <i>Reliques</i>,
which were shortly to be published, and in the preparation
of which he had so long been engaged.
The poet Shenstone was the first to suggest the
subject of this book, as he himself states in a letter
to a friend, dated March 1, 1761. "You have heard
me speak of Mr. Percy; he was in treaty with
Mr. James Dodsley for the publication of our best
old ballads in three volumes. He has a large folio
MS. of ballads, which he showed me, and which,
with his own natural and acquired talents, would
qualify him for the purpose as well as any man
in England. I proposed the scheme to him myself,
wishing to see an elegant edition and good
collection of this kind. I was also to have assisted
him in selecting and rejecting, and fixing upon the
best readings; but my illness broke off the correspondence
in the beginning of winter."</p>

<p>In February, 1765, appeared the first edition of
the <i>Reliques</i>, which gave Percy a name, and obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[Pg lxxvi]</a></span>
for him the patronage of the great. He became
Chaplain and Secretary to the Duke of Northumberland,
with whose family he kept up intimate relations
throughout his life. The Northumberland <i>Household</i>
<i>Book</i>, which he compiled in accordance with the
wishes of his patron, was privately printed in the
year 1768.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> In 1769 he was appointed Chaplain to
George III., and in the following year appeared his
translation of Mallet's <i>Northern Antiquities</i>. Each
of these three works was the first of its class, and
created a taste which produced a literature of the
same character. The <i>Household Book</i> gave rise to
a large number of publications which have put us in
possession of numerous facts relating to the domestic
expenses and habits of the royal and noble families
of old England. The mythology of the Eddas was
first made known to English readers by Percy, and
in his Preface to Mallet's work he clearly pointed
out the essential difference between the Celtic and
Teutonic races, which had previously been greatly
overlooked.</p>

<p>The remuneration which Percy received for his
labours was not large. Fifty pounds was the pay
for the Chinese novel, and one hundred guineas for
the first edition of the <i>Reliques</i>. The agreements
he made with the Tonsons were fifty guineas for
Buckingham's <i>Works</i> and twenty guineas for Surrey's
<i>Poems</i>. He also agreed to edit the <i>Spectator</i> and
<i>Guardian</i>, with notes, for one hundred guineas, but
was obliged to abandon his intention on account of
the engrossing character of his appointments in the
Northumberland family.</p>

<p>About this time Mrs. Percy was appointed nurse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[Pg lxxvii]</a></span>to Prince Edward, the infant son of George III.,
afterwards Duke of Kent, and father of her present
Majesty, who was born in 1767.</p>

<p>In 1770 Percy took his degree of D.D. at Cambridge,
having incorporated himself at Emmanuel
College, the master of which was his friend, Dr. Farmer,
to be remembered as the Shakspere commentator.
Later on in the year he lost his eldest daughter,
and in January, 1771, yet another child was buried
in the village church. In 1771 he printed the <i>Hermit</i>
<i>of Warkworth</i>, which exhibited his continued
interest in the subject of the <i>Reliques</i>, and we find
him for many years after this date continually writing
to his literary correspondents for information relating
to old ballads.</p>

<p>In 1778 Percy obtained the Deanery of Carlisle,
which four years afterwards he resigned on being
appointed to the bishopric of Dromore, worth <i>&pound;</i>2,000
a year. He did not resign his vicarage and rectory
until the same time, and he was succeeded in the first
by Robert Nares, the compiler of the well-known glossary.
It was in 1778 that the memorable quarrel between
Percy and Johnson occurred which is graphically
described by Boswell. The cause of the heat
was the different views held by the two disputants as to
the merits of the traveller Pennant. When the reconciliation
was brought about Johnson's contribution
to the peace was, "My dear sir, I am willing you
shall hang Pennant."</p>

<p>In this same year Percy was writing about his
son Henry, then a tall youth of fifteen, who he
hoped in a few years would be able to edit the
<i>Reliques</i> for him, but in April, 1783, soon after he
had settled at Dromore, a great sorrow fell upon
him, and this only and much-loved son died at the
early age of twenty. In 1780 a large portion of
Northumberland House, Strand, was consumed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[Pg lxxviii]</a></span>
fire, when Percy's apartments were burnt. The chief
part of his library, was, however, saved. Four very
interesting letters of the bishop's, written to George
Steevens in 1796 and 1797, are printed in the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> for 1848 (pp. 437 and 604). The first
relates to his edition of Goldsmith's works, which
was published in 1801 in four volumes octavo. His
object in undertaking the labour was to benefit two
surviving relations of Goldsmith, and he complains
to Steevens that the publishers had thwarted him in
his purpose. The second letter is on the same
subject, and the third and fourth relate to his work
on blank verse before Milton, attached to Surrey's
Poems. In 1798 the Irish Rebellion broke out, and
Percy sent a large quantity of correspondence and
valuable books to his daughter, Mrs. Isted, for safe
preservation at Ecton House. In 1806 his long
and happy union with Mrs. Percy was abruptly
brought to a close, and to add to his afflictions he
became totally blind. He bore his trials with resignation,
and ere five more years had passed by, he
himself was borne to the tomb. On the 30th of
September, 1811, he died in the eighty-third year of
his age, having outlived nearly all his contemporaries.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>That his attachment to "Nancy" was fervent as
well as permanent, is shown by many circumstances.
One of these is a little poem printed for the first
time in the edition of the folio MS.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Percy had naturally a hot temper, but this cooled
down with time, and the trials of his later life were
accepted with Christian meekness. One of his relations,
who as a boy could just recollect him, told
Mr. Pickford "that it was quite a pleasure to see
even then his gentleness, amiability, and fondness
for children. Every day used to witness his strolling
down to a pond in the palace garden, in order to
feed his swans, who were accustomed to come at the
well-known sound of the old man's voice." He was
a pleasing companion and a steady friend. His
duties, both in the retired country village and in the
more elevated positions of dean and bishop, were all
performed with a wisdom and ardour that gained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx">[Pg lxxx]</a></span>
him the confidence of all those with whom he was
brought in contact. The praise given to him in the
inscription on the tablet to his memory in Dromore
Cathedral does not appear to have gone beyond the
truth. It is there stated that he resided constantly
in his diocese, and discharged "the duties of his
sacred office with vigilance and zeal, instructing the
ignorant, relieving the necessitous, and comforting
the distressed with pastoral affection." He was "revered
for his piety and learning, and beloved for his
universal benevolence, by all ranks and religious
denominations."</p>

<p>There are three portraits of Percy. The first and
best known was painted by Reynolds in May, 1773.
It represents him habited in a black gown and bands,
with a loose black cap on his head, and the folio MS.
in his hand. It is not known whether the original is
still in existence, but engravings from it are common.
The next was painted by Abbot in 1797, and hangs
at Ecton Hall. Percy is there represented as a
fuller-faced man, in his episcopal dress, and wearing
a wig. We have Steevens's authority for believing
this to be an excellent likeness. An engraving from
it is prefixed to the "Percy Correspondence," in
Nichols's <i>Illustrations of Literature</i>.</p>

<p>In the third volume of Dibdin's <i>Bibliographical</i>
<i>Decameron</i> is a beautiful engraving from a watercolour
drawing, which represents the bishop in his
garden at Dromore, when totally blind, feeding his
swans.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">[Pg lxxxi]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Folio MS. and the "Reliques."</span></h3>

<p>What were the sources from which Percy obtained
the chief contents of his celebrated work? They
were:&mdash;1. The folio MS.; 2. Certain other MS. collections,
the use of which he obtained; 3. The
Scotch ballads sent to him by Sir David Dalrymple
(better known by his title of Lord Hailes, which he
assumed on being appointed one of the Judges of the
Court of Session in Edinburgh); 4. The ordinary
printed broadsides; 5. The poems he extracted from
the old printed collections of fugitive poetry&mdash;<i>The</i>
<i>Paradise of Dainty Devices, England's Helicon</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In considering the above sources, it will be necessary
to give some little space to the discussion of the
connection between the folio MS. and the <i>Reliques</i>,
as it is not generally understood by the ordinary
readers of the latter.</p>

<p>The folio MS. came into Percy's hands early in his
life, and the interest of its contents first caused him
to think of forming his own collection. One of the
notes on the covers of the MS. is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"When I first got possession of this MS. I was
very young, and being no degree an antiquary, I had
not then learnt to reverence it; which must be my
excuse for the scribble which I then spread over some
parts of its margin, and, in one or two instances, for
even taking out the leaves to save the trouble of
transcribing. I have since been more careful. T. P."</p>

<p>He showed it to his friends, and immediately after
the publication of the <i>Reliques</i> he deposited it at the
house of his publishers, the Dodsleys, of Pall Mall.
In spite of all this publicity, Ritson actually denied
the very existence of the MS. Another memorandum
on the cover of the folio was written on Nov. 7, 1769.
It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">[Pg lxxxii]</a></span></p>

<p>"This very curious old manuscript, in its present
mutilated state, but unbound and sadly torn, &amp;c., I
rescued from destruction, and begged at the hands of
my worthy friend Humphrey Pitt, Esq., then living
at Shiffnal, in Shropshire, afterwards of Priorslee, near
that town; who died very lately at Bath (viz., in summer
1769). I saw it lying dirty on the floor, under a
Bureau in y<sup>e</sup> Parlour: being used by the maids to
light the fire. It was afterwards sent, most unfortunately,
to an ignorant Bookbinder, who pared the
margin, when I put it into Boards in order to lend it
to Dr. Johnson. Mr. Pitt has since told me that he
believes the transcripts into this volume, &amp;c., were
made by that Blount who was author of <i>Jocular</i>
<i>Tenures</i>, &amp;c., who he thought was of Lancashire or
Cheshire, and had a remarkable fondness for these
old things. He believed him to be the same person
with that Mr. Thomas Blount who published the
curious account of King Charles the 2<sup>ds</sup> escape intitled
<i>Boscobel</i>, &amp;c., Lond. 1660, 12mo, which has been
so often reprinted. As also the <i>Law Dictionary</i>,
1671, folio, and many other books which may be seen
in Wood's <i>Athen&aelig;</i>, ii. 73, &amp;c. A Descendant or
Relation of that Mr. Blount was an apothecary at
Shiffnal, whom I remember myself (named also
Blount). He (if I mistake not) sold the Library of
the said predecessor Thos. Blount to the above-mentioned
Mr. Humph<sup>y</sup> Pitt: who bought it for the
use of his nephew, my ever-valued friend Rob<sup>t</sup> Binnel.
Mr. Binnel accordingly had all the printed books, but
this MS. which was among them was neglected and
left behind at Mr. Pitt's house, where it lay for many
years. <span class="smcap">T. Percy.</span>"</p>

<p>Mr. Furnivall believes that the copier of the MS.
must have been a man greatly inferior to Thomas
Blount, who was a barrister of the Middle Temple,
of considerable learning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiii" id="Page_lxxxiii">[Pg lxxxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>Percy afterwards kept the volume very much to
himself, and Ritson affirmed that "the late Mr.
Tyrwhitt, an excellent judge and diligent peruser of
old compositions, and an intimate friend of the
owner, never saw it."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Although Jamieson was
obliged by receiving a copy of three of the pieces in
the MS., he was not allowed a sight of the volume,
and no one else was permitted to make any use of
it. This spirit of secrecy was kept up by the bishop's
descendants, who refused all who applied to see
it. Sir Frederic Madden alone was allowed to
print some pieces in his <i>Syr Gawayne</i> for the Bannatyne
Club, 1839. The public obtained a glimpse of
its contents through Dr. Dibdin, who copied from
Percy's list the first seventy-two entries, and would
have finished the whole, had he not been stopped
by his entertainers (Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Isted, of
Ecton Hall), when they found out what he was
about. He gave in his <i>Bibliographical Decameron</i>
a description of the MS. which he thus handled in
the winter of 1815. Mr. Furnivall writes as follows
of his several attempts to get the MS. printed, and
of his success at last: "The cause of the printing
of Percy's MS., of the publication of the book, was
the insistence time after time by Professor Child,
that it was the duty of English antiquarian men of
letters to print this foundation document of English
balladry, the basis of that structure which Percy
raised, so fair to the eyes of all English-speaking
men throughout the world. Above a hundred years
had gone since first the <i>Reliques</i> met men's view,
a Percy Society had been born and died, but still the
Percy manuscript lay hid in Ecton Hall, and no one
was allowed to know how the owner who had made
his fame by it had dealt with it, whether his treatment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">[Pg lxxxiv]</a></span>was foul or fair. No list even of its contents could
be obtained. Dibdin and Madden, and many a
man less known had tried their hands, but still the
MS. was kept back, and this generation had made
up its mind that it was not to see the desired original
in type.... I tried to get access to the MS. some
half-a-dozen years ago. Repulsed, I tried again
when starting the Early English Text Society.
Repulsed again, I tried again at a later date, but
with the like result. Not rebuffed by this, Professor
Child added his offer of <i>&pound;</i>50 to mine of <i>&pound;</i>100,
through Mr. Thurstan Holland, a friend of his own
and of the owners of the MS., and this last attempt
succeeded." The less said the better about the conduct
of these owners who were only to be tempted to confer
a public benefit by the increased offers of two private
gentlemen, but there cannot be two opinions about
the spirited conduct of Mr. Furnivall and Professor
Child. The three volumes<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> that the printed
edition of the MS. occupy, form a handsome monument of
well-directed labour. The text is printed with the
most careful accuracy under the superintendence of
Mr. Furnivall, and the elaborate prefaces which
exhibit that union of judgment and taste for which
Mr. Hales is so well known, leave nothing to be
desired.</p>

<p>"The manuscript itself is a 'scrubby, shabby paper'
book, about fifteen and a half inches long by five and
a half wide, and about two inches thick, which has
lost some of its pages both at the beginning and
end.... The handwriting was put by Sir F. Madden
at after 1650 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>; by two authorities at the
Record Office whom I consulted, in the reign of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">[Pg lxxxv]</a></span>James I. rather than that of Charles I., but as the
volume contains, among other late pieces, one on the
siege of Newark in Charles I.'s time (ii. 33), another
on the taking of Banbury in 1642 (ii. 39), and a
third, <i>The King inioyes his rights againe</i>, which contains
a passage<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> that (as Mr. Chappell observes in
<i>Pop. Mus.</i> ii. 438, note 2) fixes the date of the song
to the year 1643, we must make the date about
1650, though rather before than after, so far as I
can judge. I should keep it in Charles I.'s reign,
and he died Jan. 30, 1649, but within a quarter of a
century one can hardly determine.... The dialect
of the copier of the MS. seems to have been Lancashire,
as is shown by the frequent use of the final
<i>st, thoust</i> for <i>thou shalt, Ist</i> for <i>I will, youst</i> for <i>you</i>
<i>will</i>, <i>unbethought</i> for <i>umbethought</i>, and the occurrence
of the northern terms, like <i>strang</i>, <i>gange</i>, &amp;c.
&amp;c. Moreover, the strong local feeling shown by
the copier in favour of Lancashire and Cheshire,
and the Stanleys, in his choice of <i>Flodden Feilde</i>,
<i>Bosworth Feilde</i>, <i>Earles of Chester</i>, <i>Ladye Bessiye</i>,
confirms the probability that he was from one of the
counties named. That much, if not all, of the MS.
was written from dictation and hurriedly is almost
certain, from the continual miswriting of <i>they</i> for
<i>the</i>, <i>rought</i> for <i>wrought</i>, <i>knight</i> for <i>night</i> (once), <i>me</i>
fancy for <i>my</i> fancy, <i>justine</i> for <i>justing</i>."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>A very erroneous impression has grown up as to
the proportion of pieces in the <i>Reliques</i> which were
taken from the MS. This is owing to a misleading
statement made by Percy in his preface, to the effect
that "the greater part of them are extracted from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">[Pg lxxxvi]</a></span>an ancient MS. in the editor's possession, which
contains near two hundred poems, songs, and metrical
romances." The fact is that only one-fourth
were so taken. The <i>Reliques</i> contain 180 pieces,
and of these only forty-five<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> are taken from the
manuscript. We thus see that a very small part of
the manuscript was printed by Percy. He mentions
some of the other pieces in various parts of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">[Pg lxxxvii]</a></span>book, and he proposed to publish a fourth volume
of the <i>Reliques</i> at some future period that never
came.</p>

<p>Mr. Furnivall has the following remarks on the
gains to literature by the publication of the manuscript:
"It is more that we have now for the first
time <i>Eger and Grime</i> in its earlier state, <i>Sir Lambewell</i>,
besides the <i>Cavilere's</i> praise of his hawking,
the complete versions of <i>Scottish Feilde</i> and <i>Kinge</i>
<i>Arthur's Death</i>, the fullest of <i>Flodden Feilde</i> and
the verse <i>Merline</i>, the <i>Earle of Westmorlande</i>, <i>Bosworth</i>
<i>Feilde</i>, the curious poem of <i>John de Reeve</i>,
and the fine alliterative one of <i>Death and Liffe</i>, with
its gracious picture of Lady dame Life, awakening
life and love in grass and tree, in bird and man, as
she speeds to her conquest over death."</p>

<p>In 1774 Percy wrote: "In three or four years I
intend to publish a volume or two more of old English
and Scottish poems in the manner of my
<i>Reliques</i>." And again in 1778: "With regard to
the <i>Reliques</i>, I have a large fund of materials, which
when my son has compleated his studies at the
University, he may, if he likes it, distribute into one
or more additional volumes." The death of this
son put an end to his hopes, but before the fourth
edition was required, the bishop had obtained the
assistance of his nephew, the Rev. Thomas Percy.
In 1801 he wrote as follows to Jamieson, who had
asked for some extracts from the folio: "Till my
nephew has completed his collection for the intended
fourth volume it cannot be decided whether he may
not wish to insert himself the fragments you desire;
but I have copied for you here that one which you
particularly pointed out, as I was unwilling to disappoint
your wishes and expectations altogether.
By it you will see the defective and incorrect state
of the old text in the ancient folio MS., and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">[Pg lxxxviii]</a></span>
irresistible demand on the editor of the <i>Reliques</i> to
attempt some of those conjectural emendations,
which have been blamed by one or two rigid critics,
but without which the collection would not have
deserved a moment's attention."</p>

<p>Percy has been very severely judged for the alterations
he made in his manuscript authorities; and Ritson
has attempted to consider his conduct as a question
of morality rather than one of taste. As each
point is noticed in the prefaces to the various pieces,
it is not necessary to discuss the question here. It
may, however, be remarked that, in spite of all Ritson's
attacks (and right was sometimes on his side),
the <i>Reliques</i> remain to the present day unsuperseded.</p>

<p>Mr. Thoms communicated to the <i>Notes and</i>
<i>Queries</i> (5th series, v. 431) the following note, which
he made upwards of forty years ago, after a conversation
with Francis Douce:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Douce told me that the Bishop (Percy)
originally intended to have left the manuscript to
Ritson; but the reiterated abuse with which that
irritable and not always faultless antiquary visited
him obliged him to alter his determination. With
regard to the alterations (? amendments) made by
Percy in the text, Mr. Douce told me that he (Percy)
read to him one day from the MS., while he held the
work in his hand to compare the two; and 'certainly
the variations were greater than I could have expected,'
said my old friend, with a shrug of the
shoulders."</p>

<p>Of the other sources from which Percy drew his
materials little need be said. 2. Some of the ballads
were taken from MSS. in public libraries, and others
from MSS. that were lent to him. 3. The Scotch
ballads supplied by Sir David Dalrymple have
already been referred to. 4. The printed ballads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">[Pg lxxxix]</a></span>
are chiefly taken from the Pepys Collection at Cambridge.
5. When the <i>Reliques</i> were first published,
the elegant poems in the <i>Paradyse of Daynty Devises,</i>
<i>England's Helicon</i>, were little known, and it was a
happy thought on the part of Percy to intersperse
these smaller pieces among the longer ballads, so as
to please the reader with a constant variety.</p>

<p>The weak point in the book is the insertion of
some of the modern pieces. The old minstrel believed
the wonders he related; but a poet educated
in modern ideas cannot transfer himself back to the
times of chivalry, so that his attempts at imitating
"the true Gothic manner" are apt to fill his readers
with a sense of unreality.</p>

<p>After the first edition of the <i>Reliques</i> was printed,
and before it was published, Percy made a great
alteration in its arrangement. The first volume was
turned into the third, and the third into the first, as
may be seen by a reference to the foot of the pages
where the old numbering remains. By this means
the <i>Arthur Ballads</i> were turned off to the end, and
<i>Chevy Chase</i> and <i>Robin Hood</i> obtained the place of
honour. Several ballads were also omitted at the
last moment, and the numbers left vacant. These
occur in a copy of two volumes at Oxford which
formerly belonged to Douce. In Vol. III. (the old
Vol. I.), Book 1, there is no No. 19; in the Douce
copy this is filled by <i>The Song-birds</i>. In Vol. II.,
Book 3, there are no Nos. 10 and 11; but in the Douce
copy, Nos. 9, 10, and 11 are <i>Cock Lorrell's Treat</i>,
<i>The Moral Uses of Tobacco</i>, and <i>Old Simon the</i>
<i>Kinge</i>. Besides these omissions it will be seen that
in Book 3 of Vol. III. there are two Nos. 2; and that
<i>George Barnwell</i> must have been inserted at the last
moment, as it occupies a duplicate series of pages
225-240, which are printed between brackets. In
1765 the volumes were published in London. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xc" id="Page_xc">[Pg xc]</a></span>
the following year a surreptitious edition was published
in Dublin, and in 1767 appeared a second
edition in London. In 1775 was published the third
edition, which was reprinted at Frankfort in 1790.
The fourth edition, ostensibly edited by the Rev.
Thomas Percy, but really the work of the bishop
himself, was published in 1794. Many improvements
were made in this edition, and it contains Percy's
final corrections; the fifth edition, published in 1812,
being merely a reprint of the fourth.</p>

<p>The year 1765 was then a memorable one in the
history of literature. The current ballads which were
bawled in the street, or sung in the ale-house, were so
mean and vulgar that the very name of ballad had
sunk into disrepute. It was therefore a revelation to
many to find that a literature of nature still existed
which had descended from mother to child in remote
districts, or was buried in old manuscripts, covered
with the dust of centuries. It is necessary to realize
this state of things in order to understand Percy's
apologetic attitude. He collected his materials from
various sources with great labour, and spared no
pains in illustrating the poetry by instructive prose.
Yet after welding with the force of genius the various
parts into an harmonious whole, he was doubtful of
the reception it was likely to obtain, and he called
the contents of his volumes "the barbarous productions
of unpolished ages." He backed his own
opinion of their interest by bringing forward the
names of the chiefs of the republic of letters, and ill
did they requite him. Johnson parodied his verses,
and Warburton sneered at him as the man "who
wrote about the Chinese." Percy looked for his
reward where he received nothing but laughter;
but the people accepted his book with gladness, and
the young who fed upon the food he presented to
them grew up to found new schools of poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xci" id="Page_xci">[Pg xci]</a></span></p>

<p>Few books have exerted such extended influence
over English literature as Percy's <i>Reliques</i>. Beattie's
<i>Minstrel</i> was inspired by a perusal of the <i>Essay on</i>
<i>the Ancient Minstrels</i>; and many authors have expressed
with gratitude their obligations to the bishop
and his book.</p>

<p>How profoundly the poetry of nature, which lived
on in the ballads of the country, stirred the souls of
men is seen in the instance of two poets of strikingly
different characteristics. Scott made his first acquaintance
with the <i>Reliques</i> at the age of thirteen,
and the place where he read them was ever after
imprinted upon his memory. The bodily appetite
of youth was unnoticed while he mentally devoured
the volumes under the huge leaves of the plantain
tree. Wordsworth was not behind Scott in admiration
of the book. He wrote: "I have already stated
how much Germany is indebted to this work, and
for our own country, its poetry has been absolutely
redeemed by it. I do not think there is an able
writer in verse of the present day who would not
be proud to acknowledge his obligation to the
<i>Reliques</i>. I know that it is so with my friends;
and for myself, I am happy in this occasion to
make a public avowal of my own." After such
men as these have spoken, who can despise our old
ballads?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Ballad Literature since Percy.</span></h3>

<p>The impetus given to the collection of old ballads
by the publication of <i>Reliques</i> showed itself in the
rapid succession of volumes of the same class which
issued from the press. Most of these were devoted
to the publication of Scottish ballads exclusively. In
1769, David Herd, a native of St. Cyrus, in Kincar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcii" id="Page_xcii">[Pg xcii]</a></span>dineshire,
who had spent most of his life as clerk in
an accountant's office in Edinburgh, published his
<i>Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs, Heroic Ballads</i>,
&amp;c., a work which was enlarged into two volumes in
1776.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> He was a most successful and faithful collector,
and not being a poet, he was preserved from
the temptation of tampering with his stores. Motherwell
mentions twenty ballads which had not appeared
in a collected form before the publication of this work.
Herd was assisted in his editorial labours by George
Paton.</p>

<p>In 1777 appeared the first edition of Evans's <i>Old</i>
<i>Ballads, Historical and Narrative</i>, in two volumes.
The best edition of this work, edited by the son of
the original compiler, was published in 4 vols., 1810.</p>

<p>In 1781 Pinkerton published his <i>Scottish Tragic</i>
<i>Ballads</i>, which was followed in 1783 by <i>Select Scottish</i>
<i>Ballads</i>. These volumes contained several fabrications
by the editor, as already stated on a previous
page.</p>

<p>In 1783 Ritson commenced the publication of that
long series of volumes which is of such inestimable
value to the literary antiquary, with <i>A Select Collection</i>
<i>of English Songs</i>. <i>The Bishopric Garland, or</i>
<i>Durham Minstrel</i>, followed, in 1784; <i>The Yorkshire</i>
<i>Garland</i>, in 1788; the <i>Pieces of Ancient Popular</i>
<i>Poetry</i>, in 1791; <i>Ancient Songs and Ballads from</i>
<i>the reign of Henry II. to the Revolution</i>, in 1787;
<i>The Northumberland Garland</i>, in 1793; <i>Scottish</i>
<i>Songs</i>, in 1794; and <i>Robin Hood</i>, in 1795.</p>

<p>In 1787 was commenced <i>The Scots Musical Museum</i>,
by James Johnson. Johnson was a music-seller
and engraver in Edinburgh, and the work was really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xciii" id="Page_xciii">[Pg xciii]</a></span>projected by William Tytler of Woodhouselee, Dr.
Blacklock, and Samuel Clark. The first volume was
partly printed, when Burns became acquainted with
the object of the work. He then entered into the
scheme with enthusiasm, and besides "begging and
borrowing" old songs, wrote many new songs himself.</p>

<p>In 1801 was published at Edinburgh, <i>Scottish</i>
<i>Poems of the XVIth Century</i>, edited by J. G. Dalzell,
which contains a reprint of <i>Ane Compendious Booke</i>
<i>of Godly and Spirituall Songs</i>, already referred to
above.</p>

<p>In 1802 appeared the first two volumes of the only
work which is worthy to stand side by side with the
<i>Reliques</i>. Sir Walter Scott's <i>Minstrelsy of the Scottish</i>
<i>Border</i> is a book that can be read through, and
it and the <i>Reliques</i> are the only works of the class in
which the materials are welded into a whole, so as no
longer to appear a collection of units.</p>

<p>In 1806, Robert Jamieson published at Edinburgh
his <i>Popular Ballads and Songs, from Tradition,</i>
<i>Manuscripts, and scarce editions</i>. He was working upon
this book at the same time that Scott was engaged
upon his <i>Minstrelsy</i>, and he obtained much of his material
from the same source as Scott, viz. Mrs. Brown,
of Falkland; but he, nevertheless, was able to print
seventeen ballads that had not before appeared in
any published collection. Jamieson has the following
remarks on himself in the Introduction to the first
volume:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Being obliged to go, at a few weeks' warning, to
a distant part of the world, and to seek, on the shores
of the frozen Baltic, for (which his own country seems
to deny him) the means of employing his talents and
industry in some such manner as may enable him to
preserve (for a time, at least) his respectability and
a partial independence in the world, the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xciv" id="Page_xciv">[Pg xciv]</a></span>
sheets have been prepared for the press, amidst all
the anxiety and bustle of getting ready and packing
up for a voyage." (Vol. i. p. xvii.)</p>

<p>John Finlay of Glasgow published in 1808 his
<i>Scottish Historical and Romantic Ballads</i>. These
volumes only contain twenty-six ballads in all.</p>

<p>John Gilchrist's <i>Collection of Ancient and Modern</i>
<i>Scottish Ballads, Tales, and Songs</i>, (Edinburgh 1815)
is a carefully edited work, compiled from former
books.</p>

<p>In 1822 David Laing published his valuable
<i>Select Remains of the Ancient Popular Poetry of Scotland</i>,
and in 1824 C. K. Sharpe printed privately a little
volume which he entitled <i>A Ballad Book</i>. James
Maidment printed also privately <i>A North Countrie</i>
<i>Garland</i> in the same year (1824).</p>

<p>In 1825 E. V. Utterson printed "Select Pieces of
Early English Poetry, republished principally from
early printed copies in Black Letter."</p>

<p>Peter Buchan commenced his ballad career by
publishing at Peterhead, in 1825, a little volume
entitled "Gleanings of Scotch, English, and Irish
scarce old ballads, chiefly tragical and historical,
many of them connected with the localities of
Aberdeenshire." In 1828 he published his "Ancient
Ballads and Songs of the North of Scotland, hitherto
unpublished." He affirmed that his materials were
faithfully and honestly transcribed, and "they have
suffered no change since they fortunately were consigned
to me by their foster parents." A portrait is
given in this book, which represents the compiler as
a wild-looking, unkempt, man. Besides these two
books Buchan made a large collection of ballads,
songs, and poems, which he took down from the
oral recitation of the peasantry. These were pronounced
by Scott to be "decidedly and indubitably
original." The two folio MS. volumes in which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv">[Pg xcv]</a></span>
were contained came into the possession of the Percy
Society, and a selection was made from them by
J. H. Dixon, in 1845, who entitled his work <i>Scottish</i>
<i>Traditional Versions of Ancient Ballads</i> (Percy
Society Publications, vol. xvii.).</p>

<p>In 1826 Allan Cunningham published <i>The Songs</i>
<i>of Scotland</i>, to which reference has already been
made.</p>

<p>George R. Kinloch published in 1827, "Ancient
Scottish Ballads, recovered from tradition, and never
before published." He states in his introduction
that "the present collection is almost entirely composed
of ballads obtained in the 'North Countrie,'
a district hitherto but little explored, though by no
means destitute of traditional poetry."</p>

<p>In this same year appeared William Motherwell's
<i>Minstrelsy, Ancient and Modern</i>, a work of the most
sterling character, which contains the best account
of ballad literature extant.</p>

<p>In 1829 Robert Chambers published his collection
of <i>Scottish Ballads</i>, which contains eighty pieces, of
which number twelve are modern, or imitations. At
this period the editor had not elaborated his theory
that <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i> and certain other ballads
were modern imitations.</p>

<p>Peter Cunningham published <i>The Songs of England</i>
<i>and Scotland</i>, in 1835, and Thomas Wright
printed <i>The Political Songs of England from the reign</i>
<i>of John to that of Edward II.</i> in 1839, for the Camden
Society.</p>

<p>In 1840 was founded, in honour of Bishop Percy,
the Percy Society, which continued to print some of
the old Garlands and various collections of old Ballads
until 1852.</p>

<p>William Chappell published in 1840 his valuable
<i>Collection of National English Airs, consisting of</i>
<i>Ancient Song, Ballad and Dance Tunes</i>, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcvi" id="Page_xcvi">[Pg xcvi]</a></span>
work was re-arranged and enlarged, and issued in
1855 as <i>Popular Music of the Olden Time</i>. This
work is a mine of wealth concerning both the airs
and the words of our ballad treasures. It was a
truly national undertaking, and has been completed
with great skill. No ballad lover can get on without
it.</p>

<p>In 1844 Alexander Whitelaw published <i>The</i>
<i>Book of Scottish Ballads</i>, and <i>The Book of Scottish</i>
<i>Song</i>. An edition of the former was printed in
1875, and one of the latter in 1866, which contains
about twelve hundred and seventy songs.</p>

<p>In 1847 John Matthew Gutch published "<i>A Lytell</i>
<i>Geste of Robin Hode</i>, with other Ancient and Modern
Ballads and Songs relating to this celebrated yeoman."</p>

<p>In the same year appeared Frederick Sheldon's
<i>Minstrelsy of the English Border</i>, but it is a work of
very little value.</p>

<p>Dr. Rimbault printed in 1850 those valuable
<i>Musical Illustrations of Bishop Percy's Reliques</i>,
which are so frequently quoted in the following
pages.</p>

<p>Professor Francis James Child, of Harvard College,
one of our greatest authorities on Ballad lore,
published at Boston, U.S., a very complete collection
of <i>English and Scottish Ballads</i>, in eight volumes.
The first volume contains a full list of the principal
collections of Ballads and Songs.</p>

<p>In 1858 William Edmondstoune Aytoun published
his <i>Ballads of Scotland</i>, which contain collated versions
of one hundred and thirty-nine ballads, with
short introductions.</p>

<p>The year 1867 was memorable as seeing the publication
of the first instalment of the Folio Manuscript
under the editorship of J. W. Hales and F. J. Furnivall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcvii" id="Page_xcvii">[Pg xcvii]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1868 appeared "Scottish Ballads and Songs,
historical and traditionary, edited by James Maidment,
Edinburgh, 1868," 2 vols. The number of
pieces is small but select, and the introductions are
full and elaborate.</p>

<p>In 1871 Messrs. Ogle of Glasgow published a
well edited collection of Scottish Ballads, with an
interesting introduction and notes, entitled "The
Ballad Minstrelsy of Scotland. Romantic and Historical.
Collated and Annotated."</p>

<p>Upon the completion of the Percy Folio, Mr. Furnivall
started the Ballad Society, for the publication
of the various collections of ballads that exist. Mr.
Chappell has edited half of the Roxburghe Ballads
in several parts, and Mr. Furnivall himself has
printed some interesting ballads from manuscripts.
All these have been presented to readers with a
wealth of illustrative notes.</p>

<p>The books referred to above form but a portion of
the literature of the subject. So mighty has been the
growth of the small seed set by Percy, that the despised
outcasts which the literary leaders attempted
to laugh out of existence have made good their right
to a high position among the poetry of the nation,
and proved that they possessed the germs of a long
and vigorous life.</p>

answer my inquiry whether he still held the opinion he published
in 1839. He writes (June 2, 1876): "I still adhere to the general
inference that this ballad is comparatively a modern imitation, and
although we have no positive evidence as to the authorship, I can
think of no one that was so likely to have written it as Elizabeth
Halket, Lady Wardlaw of Pitreavie, who died in 1727, aged fifty.
Had Bishop Percy's correspondence with Sir David Dalrymple,
Lord Hailes, been preserved, some interesting information would
no doubt have been obtained regarding these ballads sent from

<p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Percy communicated to Dr. Nash, for the <i>History of Worcestershire</i>
(vol. ii. p. 318), a pedigree in which he attempted to
identify his family with that of the descendants of Ralph, third
Earl of Northumberland. Nash subjoined a note to the effect
that he had examined the proofs of all the particulars above
mentioned, and Boswell, in his <i>Life of Johnson</i>, expressed the
opinion that, "both as a lawyer accustomed to the consideration
of evidence, and as a genealogist versed in the study of pedigrees,"
he was fully satisfied. Mr. Furnivall is rather unjust to Percy
when he suggests that the pedigree was treated like the ballads,
and the gaps filled up, for the cases are not quite analogous. The
pedigree may not be of greater authenticity than many other
doubtful ones, but at all events his Patrons the Duke and Duchess
of Northumberland acknowledged the connection between them
when he was in some way distinguished.</p></div>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Those</span> writers, who solicit the protection
of the noble and the great, are
often exposed to censure by the impropriety
of their addresses: a remark
that will, perhaps, be too readily applied
to him, who, having nothing better to offer
than the rude songs of ancient minstrels, aspires to
the patronage of the Countess of Northumberland,
and hopes that the barbarous productions of unpolished
ages can obtain the approbation or notice
of her, who adorns courts by her presence, and
diffuses elegance by her example.</p>

<p>But this impropriety, it is presumed, will disappear,
when it is declared that these poems are
presented to your Ladyship, not as labours of art, but
as effusions of nature, showing the first efforts of
ancient genius, and exhibiting the customs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
opinions of remote ages: of ages that had been
almost lost to memory, had not the gallant deeds
of your illustrious ancestors preserved them from
oblivion.</p>

<p>No active or comprehensive mind can forbear
some attention to the reliques of antiquity. It is
prompted by natural curiosity to survey the progress
of life and manners, and to inquire by what gradations
barbarity was civilized, grossness refined, and
ignorance instructed; but this curiosity, Madam,
must be stronger in those who, like your Ladyship,
can remark in every period the influence of some
great progenitor, and who still feel in their effects
the transactions and events of distant centuries.</p>

<p>By such bonds, Madam, as I am now introducing
to your presence, was the infancy of genius nurtured
and advanced, by such were the minds of unlettered
warriors softened and enlarged, by such was the
memory of illustrious actions preserved and propagated,
by such were the heroic deeds of the Earls
of Northumberland sung at festivals in the hall of
Alnwick; and those songs, which the bounty of
your ancestors rewarded, now return to your Ladyship
by a kind of hereditary right; and, I flatter
myself, will find such reception as is usually shown
to poets and historians, by those whose consciousness
of merit makes it their interest to be long
remembered.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Twenty</span> years have near elapsed since
the last edition of this work appeared.
But, although it was sufficiently a
favourite with the public, and had long
been out of print, the original editor
had no desire to revive it. More important pursuits
had, as might be expected, engaged his attention;
and the present edition would have remained unpublished,
had he not yielded to the importunity of
his friends, and accepted the humble offer of an
editor in a nephew, to whom, it is feared, he will be
found too partial.</p>

<p>These volumes are now restored to the public
with such corrections and improvements as have
occurred since the former impression; and the text
in particular hath been emended in many passages
by recurring to the old copies. The instances, being
frequently trivial, are not always noted in the margin;
but the alteration hath never been made without
good reason; and especially in such pieces as were
extracted from the folio manuscript so often mentioned
in the following pages, where any variation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>occurs from the former impression, it will be understood
to have been given on the authority of
that MS.</p>

<p>The appeal publicly made to Dr. Johnson in the
first page of the following Preface, so long since as
in the year 1765, and never once contradicted by
him during so large a portion of his life, ought to
have precluded every doubt concerning the existence
of the MS. in question. But such, it seems, having
been suggested, it may now be mentioned, that,
while this edition passed through his press, the MS.
itself was left for near a year with Mr. Nichols, in
whose house, or in that of its possessor, it was
examined with more or less attention by many gentlemen
of eminence in literature. At the first publication
of these volumes it had been in the hands of
all, or most of, his friends; but, as it could hardly be
expected that he should continue to think of nothing
else but these amusements of his youth, it was afterwards
laid aside at his residence in the country. Of
the many gentlemen above-mentioned, who offered
to give their testimony to the public, it will be sufficient
to name the Honourable Daines Barrington,
the Reverend Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode, and
those eminent Critics on Shakespeare, the Reverend
Dr. Farmer, George Steevens, Esq., Edmund
Malone, Esq., and Isaac Reed, Esq., to whom I beg
leave to appeal for the truth of the following representation.</p>

<p>The MS. is a long narrow folio volume, containing
195 Sonnets, Ballads, Historical Songs, and Metrical
Romances, either in the whole or in part, for many
of them are extremely mutilated and imperfect. The
first and last leaves are wanting; and of fifty-four
pages near the beginning half of every leaf hath
been torn away, and several others are injured
towards the end; besides that through a great part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
of the volume the top or bottom line, and sometimes
both have been cut off in the binding.</p>

<p>In this state is the MS. itself: and even where
the leaves have suffered no injury, the transcripts,
which seem to have been all made by one person
(they are at least all in the same kind of hand), are
sometimes extremely incorrect and faulty, being in
such instances probably made from defective copies,
or the imperfect recitation of illiterate fingers; so
that a considerable portion of the song or narrative
is sometimes omitted; and miserable trash or nonsense
not unfrequently introduced into pieces of
considerable merit. And often the copyist grew so
weary of his labour as to write on without the least
attention to the sense or meaning; so that the word
which should form the rhyme is found misplaced in
the middle of the line; and we have such blunders
as these, <i>want and will</i> for <i>wanton will</i>;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> even <i>pan</i>
<i>and wale</i> for <i>wan and pale</i>,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>Hence the public may judge how much they are
indebted to the composer of this collection; who, at
an early period of life, with such materials and such
subjects, formed a work which hath been admitted
into the most elegant libraries; and with which the
judicious antiquary hath just reason to be satisfied,
while refined entertainment hath been provided for
every reader of taste and genius.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> reader is here presented with select
remains of our ancient English bards
and minstrels, an order of men, who
were once greatly respected by our
ancestors, and contributed to soften the
roughness of a martial and unlettered people by their
songs and by their music.</p>

<p>The greater part of them are extracted from an
ancient folio manuscript, in the editor's possession,
which contains near 200 poems, songs, and metrical
romances. This MS. was written about the middle
of the last century; but contains compositions of all
times and dates, from the ages prior to Chaucer, to
the conclusion of the reign of Charles I.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>This manuscript was shewn to several learned
and ingenious friends, who thought the contents too
curious to be consigned to oblivion, and importuned
the possessor to select some of them, and give them
to the press. As most of them are of great simplicity,
and seem to have been merely written for the
people, he was long in doubt, whether, in the present
state of improved literature, they could be deemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>worthy the attention of the public. At length the
importunity of his friends prevailed, and he could
refuse nothing to such judges as the author of the
<i>Rambler</i> and the late Mr. Shenstone.</p>

<p>Accordingly such specimens of ancient poetry have
been selected, as either shew the gradation of our
language, exhibit the progress of popular opinions,
display the peculiar manners and customs of former
ages, or throw light on our earlier classical poets.</p>

<p>They are here distributed into volumes, each of
which contains an independent series of poems, arranged
chiefly according to the order of time, and
shewing the gradual improvements of the English
language and poetry from the earliest ages down to
the present. Each volume, or series, is divided into
three books, to afford so many pauses, or resting-places
to the reader, and to assist him in distinguishing
between the productions of the earlier, the middle,
and the latter times.</p>

<p>In a polished age, like the present, I am sensible
that many of these reliques of antiquity will require
great allowances to be made for them. Yet have
they, for the most part, a pleasing simplicity, and
many artless graces, which in the opinion of no mean
critics<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> have been thought to compensate for the
want of higher beauties, and, if they do not dazzle
the imagination, are frequently found to interest the
heart.</p>

<p>To atone for the rudeness of the more obsolete
poems, each volume concludes with a few modern
attempts in the same kind of writing: and, to take
off from the tediousness of the longer narratives,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>they are everywhere intermingled with little elegant
pieces of the lyric kind. Select ballads in the old
Scottish dialect, most of them of the first-rate merit,
are also interspersed among those of our ancient
English minstrels; and the artless productions of
these old rhapsodists are occasionally confronted
with specimens of the composition of contemporary
poets of a higher class; of those who had all the
advantages of learning in the times in which they
lived, and who wrote for fame and for posterity. Yet
perhaps the palm will be frequently due to the old
strolling minstrels, who composed their rhymes to be
sung to their harps, and who looked no farther than
for present applause, and present subsistence.</p>

<p>The reader will find this class of men occasionally
described in the following volumes, and some particulars
relating to their history in an Essay subjoined.
(Appendix I.)</p>

<p>It will be proper here to give a short account of
the other collections that were consulted, and to
make my acknowledgements to those gentlemen who
were so kind as to impart extracts from them; for,
while this selection was making, a great number of
ingenious friends took a share in the work, and explored
many large repositories in its favour.</p>

<p>The first of these that deserved notice was the
Pepysian library at Magdalen College, Cambridge.
Its founder, Sam. Pepys, Esq.,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Secretary of the
Admiralty in the reigns of Charles II. and James II.
had made a large collection of ancient English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>ballads, near 2,000 in number, which he has left
pasted in five volumes in folio; besides Garlands
and other smaller miscellanies. This collection he
tells us was "begun by Mr. Selden; improved by
the addition of many pieces elder thereto in time;
and the whole continued down to the year 1700;
when the form peculiar till then thereto, viz., of the
black letter with pictures, seems (for cheapness sake)
wholly laid aside for that of the white letter without
pictures."</p>

<p>In the Ashmole Library at Oxford is a small
collection of ballads made by Anthony Wood in the
year 1676, containing somewhat more than 200.
Many ancient popular poems are also preserved in
the Bodleyan library.</p>

<p>The archives of the Antiquarian Society at London
contain a multitude of curious political poems in
large folio volumes, digested under the several
reigns of Hen. VIII., Edw. VI., Mary, Elizabeth,
James I., &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>In the British Museum is preserved a large treasure
of ancient English poems in MS. besides one
folio volume of printed ballads.</p>

<p>From all these some of the best pieces were
selected; and from many private collections, as well
printed, as manuscript, particularly from one large
folio volume which was lent by a lady.</p>

<p>Amid such a fund of materials, the editor is
afraid he has been sometimes led to make too great
a parade of his authorities. The desire of being accurate
has perhaps seduced him into too minute and
trifling an exactness; and in pursuit of information
he may have been drawn into many a petty and
frivolous research. It was, however, necessary to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>give some account of the old copies; though often,
for the sake of brevity, one or two of these only are
mentioned, where yet assistance was received from
several. Where any thing was altered that deserved
particular notice, the passage is generally distinguished
by two inverted 'commas.' And the editor
has endeavoured to be as faithful as the imperfect
state of his materials would admit. For, these old
popular rhymes being many of them copied only
from illiterate transcripts, or the imperfect recitation
of itinerant ballad-singers, have, as might be expected,
been handed down to us with less care than
any other writings in the world. And the old
copies, whether MS. or printed, were often so defective
or corrupted, that a scrupulous adherence to
their wretched readings would only have exhibited
unintelligible nonsense, or such poor meagre stuff, as
neither came from the bard, nor was worthy the
press; when, by a few slight corrections or additions,
a most beautiful or interesting sense hath started
forth, and this so naturally and easily, that the editor
could seldom prevail on himself to indulge the vanity
of making a formal claim to the improvement; but
must plead guilty to the charge of concealing his own
share in the amendments under some such general
title, as a <i>Modern Copy</i>, or the like. Yet it has
been his design to give sufficient intimation where
any considerable liberties<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> were taken with the old
copies, and to have retained either in the text or
margin any word or phrase which was antique,
obsolete, unusual, or peculiar, so that these might be
safely quoted as of genuine and undoubted antiquity.
His object was to please both the judicious antiquary,
and the reader of taste; and he hath endeavoured to
gratify both without offending either.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>The plan of the work was settled in concert with
the late elegant Mr. Shenstone, who was to have
borne a joint share in it had not death unhappily prevented
him<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>: most of the modern pieces were of his
selection and arrangement, and the editor hopes to
be pardoned if he has retained some things out of
partiality to the judgment of his friend. The old
folio MS. above-mentioned was a present from Humphrey
Pitt, Esq., of Prior's-Lee, in Shropshire,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> to
whom this public acknowledgement is due for that,
and many other obliging favours. To Sir David
Dalrymple, Bart., of Hailes, near Edinburgh, the
editor is indebted for most of the beautiful Scottish
poems with which this little miscellany is enriched,
and for many curious and elegant remarks with which
they are illustrated. Some obliging communications
of the same kind were received from John MacGowan,
Esq., of Edinburgh; and many curious explanations
of Scottish words in the glossaries from
John Davidson, Esq., of Edinburgh, and from the
Rev. Mr. Hutchinson, of Kimbolton. Mr. Warton,
who has twice done so much honour to the Poetry
Professor's chair at Oxford, and Mr. Hest, of
Wor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>cester College, contributed some curious pieces from
the Oxford libraries. Two ingenious and learned
friends at Cambridge deserve the editor's warmest
acknowledgements: to Mr. Blakeway, late fellow of
Magdalen College, he owes all the assistance received
from the Pepysian library: and Mr. Farmer, fellow
of Emanuel, often exerted, in favour of this little
work, that extensive knowledge of ancient English
literature for which he is so distinguished.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Many
extracts from ancient MSS. in the British Museum,
and other repositories, were owing to the kind
ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>vices of Thomas Astle, Esq., to whom the public is
indebted for the curious Preface and Index annexed
to the Harleyan Catalogue.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The worthy Librarian
of the Society of Antiquaries, Mr. Norris, deserved
acknowledgement for the obliging manner in which
he gave the editor access to the volumes under his
care. In Mr. Garrick's curious collection of old plays
are many scarce pieces of ancient poetry, with the
free use of which he indulged the editor in the
politest manner. To the Rev. Dr. Birch he is indebted
for the use of several ancient and valuable
tracts. To the friendship of Dr. Samuel Johnson he
owes many valuable hints for the conduct of the work.
And, if the Glossaries are more exact and curious
than might be expected in so slight a publication, it
is to be ascribed to the supervisal of a friend, who
stands at this time the first in the world for northern
literature, and whose learning is better known and
respected in foreign nations than in his own country.
It is, perhaps, needless to name the Rev. Mr. Lye,
editor of <i>Junius's Etymologicum</i>, and of the <i>Gothic</i>
<i>Gospels</i>.</p>

<p>The names of so many men of learning and character
the editor hopes will serve as an amulet to
guard him from every unfavourable censure, for
having bestowed any attention on a parcel of old
ballads. It was at the request of many of these
gentlemen, and of others eminent for their genius
and taste, that this little work was undertaken. To
prepare it for the press has been the amusement of
now and then a vacant hour amid the leisure and retirement
of rural life, and hath only served as a relaxation
from graver studies. It has been taken up
at different times, and often thrown aside for many
months, during an interval of four or five years. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>has occasioned some inconsistencies and repetitions,
which the candid reader will pardon. As great care
has been taken to admit nothing immoral and indecent,
the editor hopes he need not be ashamed of
having bestowed some of his idle hours on the
ancient literature of our own country, or in rescuing
from oblivion some pieces (though but the amusements
of our ancestors) which tend to place in a
striking light their taste, genius, sentiments, or manners.</p>

Emanuel College, the editor is obliged for many corrections
and improvements in his second and subsequent editions; as also
to the Rev. Mr. Bowle, of Idmistone, near Salisbury, editor of the
curious edition of <i>Don Quixote</i>, with Annotations in Spanish, in
6 vols. 4to.; to the Rev. Mr. Cole, formerly of Blecheley, near
Fenny-Stratford, Bucks; to the Rev. Mr. Lambe, of Noreham, in

and editor of a curious <i>Poem on the Battle of Flodden Field</i>, with
learned Notes, 1774, 8vo.); and to G. Paton, Esq., of Edinburgh.
He is particularly indebted to two friends, to whom the public as
well as himself, are under the greatest obligations; to the Honourable
Daines Barrington, for his very learned and curious <i>Observations</i>
<i>on the Statutes</i>, 4to.; and to Thomas Tyrwhitt, Esq., whose
most correct and elegant edition of Chaucer's <i>Canterbury Tales</i>,
5 vols. 8vo. is a standard book, and shows how an ancient English
classic should be published. The editor was also favoured with
many valuable remarks and corrections from the Rev. Geo. Ashby,
late fellow of St. John's College, in Cambridge, which are not
particularly pointed out because they occur so often. He was no
less obliged to Thomas Butler, Esq., F.A.S., agent to the Duke of
Northumberland, and Clerk of the Peace for the County of
Middlesex, whose extensive knowledge of ancient writings, records,
and history, have been of great use to the editor in his
attempts to illustrate the literature or manners of our ancestors.
Some valuable remarks were procured by Samuel Pegge, Esq.,
author of that curious work the <i>Curialia</i>, 4to.; but this impression
was too far advanced to profit by them all; which hath also been
the case with a series of learned and ingenious annotations inserted
in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for August, 1793, April, June, July,
and October, 1794, and which, it is hoped, will be continued.</p></div>

THE ANCIENT BALLAD OF CHEVY
CHASE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0115t.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> fine heroic song of <i>Chevy-Chase</i> has ever been
admired by competent judges. Those genuine strokes
of nature and artless passion, which have endeared it
to the most simple readers, have recommended it to
the most refined; and it has equally been the amusement of our
childhood, and the favourite of our riper years.</p>

<p>Mr. Addison has given an excellent critique<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> on this very
popular ballad, but is mistaken with regard to the antiquity of
the common-received copy; for this, if one may judge from the
style, cannot be older than the time of Elizabeth, and was probably
written after the elogium of Sir Philip Sidney: perhaps in consequence
of it. I flatter myself, I have here recovered the genuine
antique poem; the true original song, which appeared rude even
in the time of Sir Philip, and caused him to lament, that it was
so evil-apparelled in the rugged garb of antiquity.</p>

<p>This curiosity is printed, from an old manuscript,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> at the end of
Hearne's preface to Gul. Newbrigiensis <i>Hist.</i> 1719, 8vo. vol. i.
To the MS. copy is subjoined the name of the author, Rychard
Sheale;<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> whom Hearne had so little judgement as to suppose to
be the same with a R. Sheale, who was living in 1588. But
whoever examines the gradation of language and idiom in the
following volumes, will be convinced that this is the production
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>of an earlier poet. It is indeed expressly mentioned among some
very ancient songs in an old book intituled, <i>The Complaint of Scotland</i><a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
(fol. 42), under the title of the <i>Huntis of Chevet</i>, where
the two following lines are also quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Perssee and the Mongumrye mette,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day, that day, that gentil day:"<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which, tho' not quite the same as they stand in the ballad, yet
differ not more than might be owing to the author's quoting from
memory. Indeed whoever considers the style and orthography of
this old poem will not be inclined to place it lower than the time
of Henry VI.: as on the other hand the mention of James the
Scottish King,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> with one or two anachronisms, forbids us to
assign it an earlier date. King James I. who was prisoner in this
kingdom at the death of his father,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> did not wear the crown of
Scotland till the second year of our Henry VI.,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> but before the
end of that long reign a third James had mounted the throne.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
A succession of two or three Jameses, and the long detention of
one of them in England, would render the name familiar to the
English, and dispose a poet in those rude times to give it to any
Scottish king he happened to mention.</p>

<p>So much for the date of this old ballad: with regard to its subject,
altho' it has no countenance from history, there is room to
think it had originally some foundation in fact. It was one of the
Laws of the Marches frequently renewed between the two nations,
that neither party should hunt in the other's borders, without leave
from the proprietors or their deputies.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> There had long been a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>rivalship between the two martial families of Percy and Douglas,
which heightened by the national quarrel, must have produced
frequent challenges and struggles for superiority, petty invasions
of their respective domains, and sharp contests for the point of
honour; which would not always be recorded in history. Something
of this kind, we may suppose, gave rise to the ancient ballad
of the <i>Hunting a' the Cheviat</i>.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Percy earl of Northumberland
had vowed to hunt for three days in the Scottish border without
condescending to ask leave from earl Douglas, who was either lord
of the soil, or lord warden of the marches. Douglas would not
fail to resent the insult, and endeavour to repel the intruders by
force; this would naturally produce a sharp conflict between the
two parties: something of which, it is probable, did really happen,
tho' not attended with the tragical circumstances recorded in the
ballad: for these are evidently borrowed from the <i>Battle of Otterbourn</i>,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
a very different event, but which after-times would easily
confound with it. That battle might be owing to some such previous
affront as this of Chevy Chase, though it has escaped the
notice of historians. Our poet has evidently jumbled the two subjects
together: if indeed the lines,<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> in which this mistake is made,
are not rather spurious, and the after-insertion of some person,
who did not distinguish between the two stories.</p>

<p>Hearne has printed this ballad without any division of stanzas,
in long lines, as he found it in the old written copy; but it is usual
to find the distinction of stanzas neglected in ancient MSS.; where,
to save room, two or three verses are frequently given in one line
undivided. See flagrant instances in the <i>Harleian Catalogue</i>, No.
2253, s. 29, 34, 61, 70, <i>et passim</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Bishop Percy did well to open his book with <i>Chevy Chase</i>
and the <i>Battle of Otterburn</i>, as these two are by far the most
remarkable of the old historical ballads still left to us, and all
Englishmen must feel peculiar interest in <i>Chevy Chase</i>, as it is
one of the few northern ballads that are the exclusive growth of
the south side of the Border. The partizanship of the Englishman
is very amusingly brought out in verses 145-154, where we learn
that the Scotch king had no captain in his realm equal to the dead
Douglas, but that the English king had a hundred captains as good
as Percy. A ballad which stirred the soul of Sidney and caused
Ben Jonson to wish that he had been the author of it rather than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>of all his own works cannot but be dear to all readers of taste and
feeling. The old version is so far superior to the modern one
(see Book iii. No. 1) that it must ever be a source of regret that
Addison, who elegantly analyzed the modern version, did not know
of the original.</p>

<p>It will be well to arrange under three heads the subjects on
which a few words require to be added to Percy's preface, viz.
1. the title, 2. the occasion, 3. the author. 1. In the old version
the title given in the ballad itself is <i>the hunting of the Cheviat</i>, and
in the <i>Complaynt of Scotlande</i> it is referred to as <i>The Huntis of</i>
<i>Chevot</i>. The title of the modern version is changed to <i>Chevy</i>
<i>Chase</i>, which Dr. E. B. Nicholson has suggested to be derived
from the old French word <i>chevauch&eacute;e</i>, a foray or expedition (see
<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 3rd series, vol. xii. p. 124); but this explanation
is not needed, as the original of the modern title is found in ver. 62
as <i>Chyviat Chays</i>, which naturally became contracted into <i>Chevy</i>
<i>Chase</i>, as <i>Teviotdale</i> into <i>Tevidale</i> (ver. 50).</p>

<p>2. The ballad is so completely unhistorical that it is difficult to
give any opinion as to the occasion to which it refers, but apparently
it was written, as Bishop Percy remarks, to commemorate a
defiant expedition of one of the Lords of the Marches upon the
domain of another, but that the names of Percy and Douglas led
the writer into a confusion with the battle of Otterburn, which
was fresh in the people's memory owing to the ballad of the <i>Battle</i>
<i>of Otterburn</i>. In fact Professor Child throws out the hint that
possibly Sidney referred to the <i>Battle of Otterburn</i> and not to the
<i>Hunting of the Cheviat</i>, as he only mentions the old song of <i>Percie</i>
<i>and Douglas</i>, but it has so long been believed that Sidney spoke
of <i>Chevy Chase</i> that we should be sorry to think otherwise now.
In the note immediately following the modern version (see Book
iii. No. 1.) Bishop Percy suggests the possibility that the ballad
may refer to the battle of Pepperden fought in 1436, but this view
is highly improbable for the following reason. In both the ancient
and modern versions the battle of Humbledown is alluded to as a
future event caused by the death of Percy at Chevy Chase. Now as
Humbledown was fought in the year 1402, and as the battle of
Otterburn was the only conflict of importance on the Borders
which preceded it, and as, moreover, Otterburn is mentioned in the
ballad, there cannot well be any reference to a battle fought so
many years afterwards.</p>

<p>3. Bishop Percy is unnecessarily severe in his remark upon
Hearne, as that learned antiquary was probably correct in identifying
the Richard Sheale of the old ballad with Richard Sheale
the minstrel. Whether, however, the latter was the author, as
is argued by C. in Brydges' <i>British Bibliographer</i> (vol. 4, pp. 95-105),
is another matter. The other examples of the minstrel's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
muse are so inferior to this ballad that it is impossible to believe
him to be the author. Doubtless it was recited by him, and being
associated with his name the transcriber may naturally have supposed
him to be its maker. Sheale really flourished (or withered,
as Mr. Hales has it) at a rather earlier period than the date 1588
mentioned by Percy would lead us to imagine, for he appears to
have been writing before 1560, nevertheless the language is of a
much earlier date than this, and, moreover, a ballad of the Borders
is not likely to have been invented at Tamworth, where Sheale lived.</p>

<p><i>Chevy Chase</i> was long a highly popular song, and Bishop
Corbet, in his <i>Journey into France</i>, speaks of having sung it in his
youth. The antiquated beau in Davenant's play of the <i>Wits</i>
also prides himself on being able to sing it, and in <i>Wit's Intepreter</i>,
1671, a man when enumerating the good qualities of his
wife, cites after the beauties of her mind and her patience "her
curious voice wherewith she useth to sing <i>Chevy Chace</i>." Many
other ballads were sung to the same tune, so that we are not
always sure as to whether the original is referred to or some more
modern song. The philosopher Locke, when Secretary to the
Embassy sent by Charles II. to the Elector of Brandenburg, wrote
home a description of the Brandenburg church singing, in which
he says, "He that could not though he had a cold make better
music with a chevy chace over a pot of smooth ale, deserved well
to pay the reckoning and to go away athirst."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The writer here
probably referred to any song sung to this tune.]</p></div>

<p>&#8258; The style of this and the following ballad is uncommonly
rugged and uncouth, owing to their being writ in the very coarsest
and broadest northern dialect.</p>

<p>The battle of Hombyll-down, or Humbledon, was fought
Sept. 14, 1402 (anno 3 Hen. IV.), wherein the English, under the
command of the Earl of Northumberland and his son Hotspur,
gained a complete victory over the Scots. The village of <i>Humbledon</i>
is one mile northwest from Wooler, in Northumberland.
The battle was fought in the field below the village, near the
present Turnpike Road, in a spot called ever since <i>Red-Riggs</i>.
Humbledon is in <i>Glendale Ward</i>, a district so named in this
county, and mentioned above in ver. 163.</p></div>

<h3>II.<br />
<br />
THE BATTLE OF OTTERBOURNE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0131.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> only battle wherein an Earl of Douglas was slain
fighting with a Percy was that of Otterbourne, which is
the subject of this ballad. It is here related with the
allowable partiality of an English poet, and much in
the same manner as it is recorded in the English Chronicles.
The Scottish writers have, with a partiality at least as excusable,
related it no less in their own favour. Luckily we have a very circumstantial
narrative of the whole affair from Froissart, a French
historian, who appears to be unbiassed. Froissart's relation is
prolix; I shall therefore give it, with a few corrections, as abridged
by Carte, who has, however, had recourse to other authorities,
and differs from Froissart in some things, which I shall note in the
margin.</p>

<p>In the twelfth year of Richard II., 1388, "The Scots taking
advantage of the confusions of this nation, and falling with a party
into the West-marches, ravaged the country about Carlisle, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>carried off 300 prisoners. It was with a much greater force,
headed by some of the principal nobility, that, in the beginning of
August,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> they invaded Northumberland; and, having wasted part
of the county of Durham,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> advanced to the gates of Newcastle;
where, in a skirmish, they took a 'penon' or colours<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> belonging
to Henry lord Percy, surnamed Hotspur, son to the Earl of
Northumberland. In their retreat home, they attacked a castle
near Otterbourn: and, in the evening of Aug. 9 (as the English
writers say, or rather, according to Froissart, Aug. 15), after an unsuccessful
assault were surprised in their camp, which was very
strong, by Henry, who at the first onset put them into a good
deal of confusion. But James Earl of Douglas rallying his men,
there ensued one of the best-fought actions that happened in that
age; both armies showing the utmost bravery:<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the earl Douglas
himself being slain on the spot;<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> the Earl of Murrey mortally
wounded; and Hotspur,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> with his brother Ralph Percy, taken
prisoners. These disasters on both sides have given occasion to
the event of the engagement's being disputed. Froissart (who
derives his relation from a Scotch knight, two gentlemen of the
same country, and as many of Foix)<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> affirming that the Scots
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>remained masters of the field; and the English writers insinuating
the contrary. These last maintain that the English had the better
of the day: but night coming on, some of the northern lords,
coming with the Bishop of Durham to their assistance, killed many
of them by mistake, supposing them to be Scots; and the Earl of
Dunbar, at the same time falling on another side upon Hotspur,
took him and his brother prisoners, and carried them off while
both parties were fighting. It is at least certain, that immediately
after this battle the Scots engaged in it made the best of their way
home: and the same party was taken by the other corps about
Carlisle."</p>

<p>Such is the account collected by Carte, in which he seems not
to be free from partiality: for prejudice must own that Froissart's
circumstantial account carries a great appearance of truth, and he
gives the victory to the Scots. He, however, does justice to the
courage of both parties; and represents their mutual generosity in
such a light, that the present age might edify by the example.
"The Englyshmen on the one partye, and Scottes on the other
party, are good men of warre, for whan they mete, there is a hard
fighte without sparynge. There is no hoo<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> betwene them as long
as speares, swordes, axes, or dagers wyll endure; but lay on eche
upon other: and whan they be well beaten, and that the one party
hath obtayned the victory, they than glorifye so in their dedes of
armes, and are so joyfull, that suche as be taken, they shall be
ransomed or they go out of the felde;<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> so that shortely <i>eche of</i>
<i>them is so contente with other, that at their departynge curtoysly they</i>
<i>will saye, God thanke you</i>. But in fyghtynge one with another
there is no playe, nor sparynge." <i>Froissart's Chronicle</i> (as translated
by Sir Johan Bourchier Lord Berners), cap. cxlii.</p>

<p>The following Ballad is (in this present edition) printed from an
old MS. in the Cotton Library<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> (<i>Cleopatra</i>, c. iv.), and contains
many stanzas more than were in the former copy, which was
transcribed from a MS. in the Harleian Collection [No. 293,
fol. 52.] In the Cotton MS. this poem has no title, but in the
Harleian copy it is thus inscribed, <i>A songe made in R. 2. his</i>
<i>tyme of the battele of Otterburne, betweene Lord Henry Percye earle</i>
<i>of Northomberlande and the earle Douglas of Scotlande</i>, Anno 1388.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>But this title is erroneous, and added by some ignorant transcriber
of after-times: for, 1. The battle was not fought by the
Earl of Northumberland, who was absent, but by his son, <i>Sir</i>
<i>Henry Percy</i>, Knt., surnamed <i>Hotspur</i> (in those times they did
not usually give the title of <i>Lord</i> to an Earl's eldest son). 2. Altho'
the battle was fought in Richard II.'s time, the song is evidently
of later date, as appears from the poet's quoting the chronicles in
<i>Pt. II.</i>, ver. 26; and speaking of Percy in the last stanza as
dead. It was, however, written in all likelihood as early as the
foregoing song, if not earlier. This, perhaps, may be inferred from
the minute circumstances with which the story is related, many of
which are recorded in no chronicle, and were probably preserved
in the memory of old people. It will be observed that the authors
of these two poems have some lines in common; but which of
them was the original proprietor must depend upon their priority;
and this the sagacity of the reader must determine.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[We have here a ballad founded upon a true historical event, in
which the writer attempts to be as truthful as his national bias will
allow him. In Chevy Chase, Percy is the aggressor, but in the
"Battle of Otterburn," Douglas commences the encounter by
his action. At the period under notice the king of England
(Richard II.) was occupied in dissension with his uncle, the Duke
of Gloucester, and the Parliament, while Robert II., King of
Scotland, was very old, and his eldest son lame and inactive, so
that the Border chieftains were pretty much left to their own
devices. The Earl of Fife, a younger son of King Robert, and
certain of the great nobles, arranged among themselves that an
inroad should be made into England as a reprisal for the injuries
the Scotch had at various times sustained from the English, and
the expedition was placed under the command of James, Earl of
Douglas.</p>

<p>Besides the ballad we are now considering there are metrical
accounts of the battle in John Hardyng's <i>Chronicle</i>, Joannes de
Fordun's <i>Scoti-Chronicon</i>, and Wyntoun's <i>Orygynal Cronykil of</i>
<i>Scotland</i>. In 1857, Robert White published an interesting
<i>History of the Battle of Otterburn, fought in 1388, with Memoirs</i>
<i>of the Warriors who engaged in that memorable conflict</i>. This book
is written in an enthusiastic spirit by one who was born and bred
on the Borders, and who kept alive in his soul the true old Border
spirit. He listened on his mother's knee to the stanzas of the
modern ballad of <i>Chevy Chase</i>, which she chanted to him, and he
grew up with a feeling which he retained through life, that
Percy and Douglas were far greater men than Napoleon and
Wellington.</p>

<p>The exact date of the battle is an open question, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
authorities disagree as to this particular; thus Buchanan fixes it on
July 21st, and other writers name, respectively, August 5th, 9th,
10th, 15th, and 19th. White thinks that the battle was fought on
the evening of Wednesday and morning of Thursday, 19th and
20th of August, immediately before the full moon. In the year
1388 the new moon fell on the 6th of August, and Douglas is not
likely to have chosen a period of dark evenings for his expedition.
Another disputed point is the number of men in the
Scottish army, under Douglas. Froissart gives the numbers at
three or four hundred men-at-arms, and two thousand infantry;
Wyntoun, at near seven thousand men; Buchanan, at three
hundred horse and two thousand foot, besides servants and attendants;
Godscroft, at four thousand horsemen; Ridpath, at three
thousand men; and Scott, at three hundred men-at-arms, who,
with their followers, made up from a thousand to fifteen hundred
men, with two thousand chosen infantry. White makes the
following statement as the result of his sifting of the conflicting
accounts:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It has been supposed that the first part of this ballad down to
verse 112 was originally of Scottish manufacture, for two reasons:
1st, because Hume, of Godscroft, refers to "a Scots song,"
which begins as this does; and 2nd, because haymaking has been
over at least a month in England at Lammas, when Scotch
husbandmen are still busy "winning their hay." This last reason,
however, cannot be considered a very conclusive one, as the
seasons must be much alike on the two sides of the Border. The
second part is written from a thoroughly English stand-point. The
two Scottish versions, viz. the one given by Scott in his <i>Minstrelsy</i>
<i>of the Scottish Border</i>, and the one in <i>Herd's Collection</i>, are very
different from the English ballad.]</p></div>

<h4>THE ANCIENT BALLAD OF CHEVY CHASE.</h4>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0147s.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">[Second</span> Fit, ver. 112. <i>Agerstone.</i>] The family of <i>Haggerston</i>
of <i>Haggerston</i>, near Berwick, has been seated there
for many centuries, and still remains. <i>Thomas Haggerston</i>
was among the commissioners returned for Northumberland in
12 Hen. 6, 1433. (Fuller's <i>Worthies</i>, p. 310.) The head of this
family at present is <i>Sir Thomas Haggerston</i>, Bart., of <i>Haggerston</i>
above-mentioned.</p>

<p>N.B. The name is spelt <i>Agerstone</i>, as in the text, in Leland's
<i>Itinerary</i>, vol. vii. p. 54.<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>[Ver. 113. <i>Hartly.</i>] <i>Hartley</i> is a village near the sea in the
barony of Tinemouth, about 7 m. from North-Shields. It probably
gave name to a family of note at that time.</p>

<p>[Ver. 114. <i>Hearone.</i>] This family, one of the most ancient, was
long of great consideration in Northumberland. <i>Haddeston</i>, the
Caput Baroni&aelig; of <i>Heron</i>, was their ancient residence. It descended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>25 Edw. I. to the heir general <i>Emiline Heron</i>, afterwards Baroness
<i>Darcy</i>.&mdash;<i>Ford, &amp;c.</i>, and <i>Bockenfield</i> (in com. eodem) went at the
same time to <i>Roger Heron</i>, the heir male; whose descendants
were summoned to Parliament: Sir <i>William Heron</i> of Ford Castle
being summoned 44 Edw. III.&mdash;Ford Castle hath descended by
heirs general to the family of Delaval (mentioned in the next
article).&mdash;<i>Robert Heron</i>, Esq., who died at Newark in 1753, (father
of the Right Hon. Sir <i>Richard Heron</i>, Bart.) was heir male of the
<i>Herons</i> of Bockenfield, a younger branch of this family.&mdash;Sir
<i>Thomas Heron Middleton</i>, Bart., is heir male of the <i>Herons</i> of
Chip-Chase, another branch of the Herons of Ford Castle.</p>

<p>[Ver. 115. <i>Lovele.</i>] <i>Joh. de Lavale, miles</i>, was sheriff of Northumberland
34 Hen. VIII. <i>Joh. de Lavele, mil.</i> in the 1 Edw. VI.
and afterwards. (Fuller, 313.) In Nicholson this name is spelt
<i>Da Lovel</i>, p. 304. This seems to be the ancient family of <i>Delaval</i>,
of <i>Seaton Delaval</i>, in Northumberland, whose ancestor was one of
the 25 <i>Barons</i> appointed to be guardians of <i>Magna Charta</i>.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>[Ver. 117. <i>Rugb&egrave;.</i>] The ancient family of <i>Rokeby</i>, in Yorkshire,
seems to be here intended. In Thoresby's <i>Ducat. Leod.</i>, p. 253,
fol., is a genealogy of this house, by which it appears that the head
of the family, about the time when this ballad was written, was
Sir <i>Ralph Rokeby</i>, Knt., <i>Ralph</i> being a common name of the
<i>Rokebys</i>.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>[Ver. 119. <i>Wetharrington.</i>] <i>Rog. de Widrington</i> was sheriff of
Northumberland in 36 of Edw. III. (Fuller, p. 311.)&mdash;<i>Joh. de</i>
<i>Widrington</i> in 11 of Hen. IV. and many others of the same name
afterwards.&mdash;See also Nicholson, p. 331.&mdash;Of this family was the
late Lord Witherington.</p>

<p>[Ver. 124. <i>Mongonberry.</i>] Sir <i>Hugh Montgomery</i> was son of <i>John</i>
Lord <i>Montgomery</i>, the lineal ancestor of the present Earl of
Eglington.</p>

<p>[Ver. 125. <i>Lwdale.</i>] The ancient family of the <i>Liddels</i> were originally
from Scotland, where they were lords of <i>Liddel Castle</i>, and
of the Barony of <i>Buff</i>. (Vid. Collins's <i>Peerage</i>.) The head of
this family is the present Lord Ravensworth, of Ravensworth
Castle, in the county of Durham.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>
<h4>IN THE BATTLE OF OTTERBOURNE.</h4>

<p>[Ver. 101. <i>Mentaye.</i>] At the time of this battle the Earldom of
<i>Menteith</i> was possessed by <i>Robert Stewart</i>, Earl of Fife, third son
of K. Robert II., who, according to Buchanan, commanded the
Scots that entered by Carlisle. But our minstrel had probably an
eye to the family of <i>Graham</i>, who had this earldom when the
ballad was written. See Douglas's <i>Peerage of Scotland</i>, 1764, fol.</p>

<p>[Ver. 103. <i>Huntleye.</i>] This shews this ballad was not composed
before 1449; for in that year Alexander Lord of Gordon and
Huntley, was created Earl of <i>Huntley</i>, by K. James II.</p>

<p>[Ver. 105. <i>Bowghan.</i>] The Earl of <i>Buchan</i> at that time was
<i>Alexander Stewart</i>, fourth son of K. Robert II.</p>

<p>[Ver. 107. <i>Jhonstone&mdash;Maxwell.</i>] These two families of <i>Johnstone</i>
Lord of <i>Johnston</i>, and <i>Maxwell</i> Lord of <i>Maxwell</i>, were
always very powerful on the borders. Of the former family was
<i>Johnston</i> Marquis of Annandale: of the latter was <i>Maxwell</i> Earl
of Nithsdale. I cannot find that any chief of this family was
named Sir <i>Hugh</i>; but Sir <i>Herbert Maxwell</i> was about this time
much distinguished. (See Doug.) This might have been originally
written Sir <i>H. Maxwell</i>, and by transcribers converted
into Sir <i>Hugh</i>. So above, in No. I. v. 90. <i>Richard</i> is contracted
into <i>Ric.</i></p>

<p>[Ver. 109. <i>Swintone.</i>] <i>i. e.</i> The Laird of <i>Swintone</i>; a small village
within the Scottish border, 3 miles from Norham. This
family still subsists, and is very ancient.</p>

<p>[Ver. 111. <i>Scotte.</i>] The illustrious family of <i>Scot</i>, ancestors of
the Duke of Buccleugh, always made a great figure on the borders.
Sir <i>Walter Scot</i> was at the head of this family when the battle was
fought; but his great-grandson, Sir <i>David Scot</i>, was the hero of
that house when the ballad was written.</p>

<p>[Ibid. <i>Stewarde.</i>] The person here designed was probably Sir
<i>Walter Stewart</i>, Lord of Dalswinton and Gairlies, who was
eminent at that time. (See Doug.) From him is descended the
present Earl of Galloway.</p>

<p>[Ver. 112. <i>Agurstonne.</i>] The seat of this family was sometimes
subject to the kings of Scotland. Thus <i>Richardus Haggerstoun,</i>
<i>miles</i>, is one of the Scottish knights who signed a treaty with the
English in 1249, temp. Hen. III. (Nicholson, p. 2, note).&mdash;It was
the fate of many parts of Northumberland often to change their
masters, according as the Scottish or English arms prevailed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>[Ver. 129. <i>Murrey.</i>] The person here meant was probably Sir
<i>Charles Murray</i> of Cockpoole, who flourished at that time, and
was ancestor of the <i>Murrays</i> sometime Earls of Annandale. See
Doug. <i>Peerage</i>.</p>

<p>[Ver. 139. <i>Fitz-hughe.</i>] Dugdale (in his <i>Baron.</i> v. i. p. 403) informs
us that <i>John</i>, son of Henry Lord <i>Fitzhugh</i>, was killed at the
battle of Otterbourne. This was a Northumberland family. Vid.
Dugd. p. 403, col. 1, and Nicholson, pp. 33, 60.</p>

<p>[Ver. 141. <i>Harbotle.</i>] <i>Harbottle</i> is a village upon the river
Coquet, about 10 m. west of Rothbury. The family of <i>Harbottle</i>
was once considerable in Northumberland. (See Fuller, pp. 312,
313.) A daughter of <i>Guischard Harbottle</i>, Esq., married Sir
<i>Thomas Percy</i>, Knt., son of <i>Henry</i> the fifth,&mdash;and father of
<i>Thomas</i> seventh, Earls of Northumberland.</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0150.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">Is</span> founded upon the supposed practice of the Jews in
crucifying or otherwise murdering Christian children,
out of hatred to the religion of their parents: a practice
which has been always alledged in excuse for
the cruelties exercised upon that wretched people, but which
probably never happened in a single instance. For, if we consider,
on the one hand, the ignorance and superstition of the
times when such stories took their rise, the virulent prejudices
of the monks who record them, and the eagerness with which
they would be catched up by the barbarous populace as a pretence
for plunder; on the other hand, the great danger incurred by the
perpetrators, and the inadequate motives they could have to excite
them to a crime of so much horror; we may reasonably conclude
the whole charge to be groundless and malicious.</p>

<p>The following ballad is probably built upon some Italian legend,
and bears a great resemblance to the Prioresse's Tale in Chaucer:
the poet seems also to have had an eye to the known story of
<i>Hugh of Lincoln</i>, a child said to have been there murdered by the
Jews in the reign of Henry III. The conclusion of this ballad
appears to be wanting: what it probably contained may be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
in Chaucer. As for <i>Mirry-land Toun</i>, it is probably a corruption
of <i>Milan</i> (called by the Dutch <i>Meylandt</i>) <i>Town</i>: the <i>Pa</i> is evidently
the river <i>Po</i>; although the Adige, not the Po, runs through
Milan.</p>

<p>[This ballad, which is also known under the title of <i>Sir Hugh of</i>
<i>Lincoln</i>, was at one time so widely popular that it is preserved in
six different versions, besides fragments, and has originated a literature
of its own. Mons. Francisque Michel discovered a Norman-French
version in the Royal Library at Paris, which is supposed
to date back to the period when the murder of Sir Hugh was
to have been committed. This was first published in the year
1834 under the title, "Hugues de Lincoln: Recueil de Ballades
Anglo-Normande et Ecossoises relatives au meurtre de cet enfant
commis par les Juifs en <span class="smcap">MCCLV</span>." The Rev. Dr. A. Hume communicated
a very full paper on the subject of the tradition to the
Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool, on November 13,
1848, which is published in the Proceedings (No. 5), and Mr.
J. O. Halliwell printed, in 1849, a small volume containing
"Ballads and Poems respecting Hugh of Lincoln." In the
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> for Dec. 15, 1849, there is a condemnatory review of
Dr. Hume's work, to which the reviewer has added some valuable
information of his own. Percy's remark that <i>Mirry-land town</i> is a
corruption of Milan town, and <i>Pa</i> of the river Po, seems far-fetched,
as there is no reason for supposing that the ballad was in any way
connected with Italy. Jamieson's version reads <i>Merry Lincoln</i>,
and in Motherwell's the scene is changed to Maitland town. In
some parts of England the ballad has degenerated into a sort of
nursery rhyme, the Northamptonshire version reading "Merry
Scotland," and the Shropshire one, "Merry-cock land." Mr. J.
H. Dixon suggests <i>mere-land town</i>, from the mere or fen lakes, and
reads wa' for Pa'. (<i>Notes and Queries</i>, 3rd Series, vol. ix. p. 30,
note.)</p>

<p>Miss Agnes Strickland communicated the following lines obtained
from oral tradition at Godalming, in Surrey, to Mr. Halliwell,
who printed them in his tract:&mdash;</p>

<p>The tradition upon which this ballad is founded&mdash;that the Jews
use human blood in their preparation for the Passover, and are in
the habit of kidnapping and butchering Christian children for the
purpose&mdash;is very widely spread and of great antiquity. Eisenmenger<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>
refers to a case which occurred at Inmestar, in Syria, so
early as the year 419, but the earliest case recorded as having occurred
in Europe is that of William of Norwich, in 1137. The
following is a translation from a passage in the <i>Peterborough</i>
<i>Chronicle</i> (which ends with the death of Stephen and the accession
of Henry the Second), relating to this remarkable superstition:&mdash;"Now
we will say something of what happened in King Stephen's
time. In his time the Jews of Norwich bought a Christian child
before Easter, and tortured him with all the same torturing that
our Lord was tortured. And on Good Friday (lang frid&aelig;i) they
hanged him on a cross, for our Lord's love; and afterwards buried
him. They thought (wenden) that it should be concealed, but
our Lord showed that he was a holy martyr (m&#771;r), and the monks
took him and buried him solemnly in the monastery (minst).
And he maketh through our Lord wonderful and manifold miracles.
And he was called Saint William." Mr. Earle, in his note to this
passage,<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> says that "S. William seems to have retained his
celebrity down to the time of the Reformation, at least in Norfolk.
In Loddon church, which is advanced perpendicular of about
1500, there is a painting of his crucifixion on a panel of the rood-screen,
still in fair preservation."</p>

<p>St. William's fame, however, was eclipsed in other parts of England
by that of Sir Hugh of Lincoln, whose death was celebrated
by historians and poets. Henry III. being often in want of
money, was glad to take any opportunity of extorting it from the unfortunate
Jews, and in 1255 his exchequer particularly required
replenishing on account of the expected arrival in England of his
son Edward's newly married wife, Eleanor of Castile. In this year
a young boy was murdered, and, opportunely for the king, the
crime was charged to the Jews. It was asserted that the child
had been stolen, fattened on bread and milk for ten days, and
crucified with all the cruelties and insults of Christ's passion, in
the presence of all the Jews in England, who had been summoned
to Lincoln for the purpose. The supposed criminals were brought
to justice, and the king's commission for the trial, and the warrant
to sell the goods of the several Jews who were found guilty, are
still preserved. The Jew into whose house the child had gone to
play, tempted by the promise of his life, made a full confession,
and threw the guilt upon his brethren. Ninety-one Jews of
Lin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>coln were sent to London as accomplices, and thrown into
dungeons. Eighteen of the richest were hanged on a gallows, and
twenty more imprisoned in the Tower of London. The king was
enriched by the spoils, and the clergy of Lincoln did not lose their
opportunity, for the minster was made famous by the possession of
the martyr's tomb. Dean Milman, in relating these circumstances,
says: "Great part of the story refutes itself, but I have already
admitted the possibility that among the ignorant and fanatic Jews
there might be some who, exasperated by the constant repetition
of the charge, might brood over it so long, as at length to be
tempted to its perpetration."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Any such explanation as this, however,
does not seem necessary, for the wide-spread existence of
the superstition goes far to prove the entire falsehood at least of
the later cases, and the story of Sir Hugh was but a revival of that
of St. William. It is worth mentioning, in passing, that this
calumny was in fact a recoil upon the Jews themselves of a
weapon they had used against the Christians. As early as the
third century they affirmed that Christians in celebrating their
mysteries used to kill a child and eat its flesh. Pagans probably
learnt the calumny from the Jews, and also charged the Christians
with eating children.</p>

<p>The whole proceedings in the case of Sir Hugh are chronicled
by Matthew Paris, who was in high favour with Henry III., and
from his pages the account is transferred to the Chronicles of
Grafton, Fabyan, and Holinshed. Chaucer most probably consulted
the same source when he included the story in his <i>Canterbury</i>
<i>Tales</i>, although he shifts the scene to Asia, and makes his
Prioress say, when ending her tale with a reference to Sir Hugh:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O younge Hughe of Lyncoln; slayn also<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cursed Jewes (as it is notable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it nys <i>but a litel while ago</i>)."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Tyrwhitt, in his edition of Chaucer, notes that he found in the
first four months of the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> of Bollandus the names of
five children canonized as having been murdered by the Jews, and
he supposes that the remaining eight months would furnish at least
as many more. Tyrwhitt accepts Percy's interpretation of Mirry-land
as a corruption of the name of Milan, and under this
erroneous impression he suggests that the real occasion of the
ballad may have been the murder of the boy Simon, at Trent,
in 1475.<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>The superstition upon which all these stories are founded is said
still to prevail among the ignorant members of the Greek Church,
and it was revived at Damascus in 1840 in consequence of the
disappearance of a priest named Thomaso. Two or three Jews
were put to death before a proper judicial examination could be
made, and the popular fury was so excited that severe persecution
extended through a large part of the Turkish empire. Sir Moses
Montefiore visited the various localities with the object of obtaining
redress for his people, and he was successful. On November
6, 1840, a firman for the protection of the Jews was given at Constantinople,
which contained the following passage:&mdash;"An ancient
prejudice prevailed against the Jews. The ignorant believed that
the Jews were accustomed to sacrifice a human being, to make use
of his blood at the Passover. In consequence of this opinion the
Jews of Damascus and Rhodes, who are subjects of our empire,
have been persecuted by other nations.... But a short time
has elapsed since some Jews dwelling in the isle of Rhodes were
brought from thence to Constantinople, where they had been tried
and judged according to the new regulations, and their innocence
of the accusations made against them fully proved." The calumny,
however, was again raised in October, 1847, and the Jews were in
imminent peril when the missing boy, who had been staying at
Baalbec, reappeared in good health.</p>

<p>Within the last few years the Greek Patriarch at Constantinople
has issued a pastoral letter, in which he points out the wickedness
of the Christian persecution of the Jews. He says: "Superstition
is a detestable thing. Almost all the Christian nations of the East
have taken up the extravagant idea that the Israelites enjoy shedding
Christian blood, either to obtain thereby a blessing from
heaven, or to gratify their national rancour against Christ. Hence
conflicts and disturbances break out, by which the social harmony
between the dwellers in the same land, yea, the same fatherland,
is disturbed. Thus a report was lately spread of the abduction of
little Christian children in order to give a pretext for suspicion.
We on our side abhor such lying fancies; we regard them as the
superstitions of men of weak faith and narrow minds; and we
disavow them officially."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<p>The superstition, however, still lives on, and according to the
<i>Levant Herald</i> (1874), the Mahometans are beginning to fall into
the delusion that the sacrificial knife is applied by the Jews to
young Turks as well as to young Christians.]</p></div>

SIR CAULINE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0157.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> old romantic tale was preserved in the Editor's
folio MS. but in so very defective and mutilated a
condition (not from any chasm in the MS. but from
great omission in the transcript, probably copied
from the faulty recitation of some illiterate minstrell), and the
whole appeared so far short of the perfection it seemed to deserve,
that the Editor was tempted to add several stanzas in the
first part, and still more in the second, to connect and compleat
the story in the manner which appeared to him most interesting
and affecting.</p>

<p>There is something peculiar in the metre of this old ballad: it
is not unusual to meet with redundant stanzas of six lines; but the
occasional insertion of a double third or fourth line, as ver. 31, &amp;c.
is an irregularity I do not remember to have seen elsewhere.</p>

<p>It may be proper to inform the reader before he comes to Pt. ii.
v. 110, 111, that the Round Table was not peculiar to the reign of
K. Arthur, but was common in all the ages of chivalry. The proclaiming
a great turnament (probably with some peculiar solemnities)
was called "holding a Round Table." Dugdale tells us,
that the great baron Roger de Mortimer "having procured the
honour of knighthood to be conferred 'on his three sons' by
K. Edw. I. he, at his own costs, caused a tourneament to be held
at Kenilworth; where he sumptuously entertained an hundred
knights, and as many ladies, for three days; the like whereof was
never before in England; and there began the Round Table, (so
called by reason that the place wherein they practised those
feats was environed with a strong wall made in a round form:)
And upon the fourth day, the golden lion, in sign of triumph, being
yielded to him; he carried it (with all the company) to Warwick."&mdash;It
may further be added, that Matthew Paris frequently calls
justs and turnaments <i>Hastiludia Mens&aelig; Rotund&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>As to what will be observed in this ballad of the art of healing
being practised by a young princess; it is no more than what is
usual in all the old romances, and was conformable to real manners:
it being a practice derived from the earliest times among
all the Gothic and Celtic nations, for women, even of the highest
rank, to exercise the art of surgery. In the Northern Chronicles
we always find the young damsels stanching the wounds of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
lovers, and the wives those of their husbands.<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> And even so late
as the time of Q. Elizabeth, it is mentioned among the accomplishments
of the ladies of her court, that the "eldest of them are
skilful in surgery." See Harrison's <i>Description of England</i>, prefixed
to Hollinshed's <i>Chronicle, &amp;c.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This story of <i>Sir Cauline</i> furnishes one of the most flagrant
instances of Percy's manipulation of his authorities. In the following
poem all the verses which are due to Percy's invention are
placed between brackets, but the whole has been so much altered
by him that it has been found necessary to reprint the original
from the folio MS. at the end in order that readers may compare
the two. Percy put into his version several new incidents and
altered the ending, by which means he was able to dilute the
201 lines of the MS. copy into 392 of his own. There was no
necessity for this perversion of the original, because the story is
there complete, and moreover Percy did not sufficiently indicate
the great changes he had made, for although nearly every verse is
altered he only noted one trivial difference of reading, viz. aukeward
for backward (v. 109).</p>

<p>Motherwell reprinted this ballad in his <i>Minstrelsy</i>, and in his
prefatory note he made the following shrewd guess, which we now
know to be a correct one:&mdash;"We suspect too that the ancient
ballad had a less melancholy catastrophe, and that the brave Syr
Cauline, after his combat with the 'hend Soldan' derived as
much benefit from the leechcraft of fair Cristabelle as he did after
winning the Eldridge sword." Professor Child has expressed the
same view in his note to the ballad.</p>

<p>Buchan printed a ballad entitled <i>King Malcolm and Sir Colvin</i>,
which is more like the original than Percy's version, but Mr. Hales
is of opinion that this was one of that collector's fabrications.]</p></div>

<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">[The</span> affectedly antique orthography of this ballad has
caused some to suppose that it was a modern invention,
probably by Lady Wardlaw, the author of <i>Hardyknute</i>,
but Motherwell obtained another version from
the recitation of an old woman, which he printed in his <i>Minstrelsy</i>
under the title of "Son Davie, son Davie." He there says that
there is reason to believe that Lord Hailes "made a few slight
verbal improvements in the copy he transmitted, and altered the
hero's name to Edward, a name which, by the bye, never occurs
in a Scottish ballad except where allusion is made to an English
king."</p>

<p>There is a Swedish ballad of the same character entitled <i>The</i>
<i>Fratricide's Lament and Dialogue with his Mother before he wanders</i>
<i>away from home for ever</i>.</p>

<p>The form of a dialogue between a mother and her son is a
favourite one in the old ballads, and "Lord Donald" in Kinloch's
<i>Scottish Ballads</i> and "Lord Randal" in Scott's <i>Minstrelsy</i> bear some
likeness to the ballad of "Edward." The hero is supposed to
have been poisoned by eating toads prepared as a dish of fishes,
and the last stanza of Kinloch's ballad is as follows:&mdash;</p></div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> old Romantic Legend (which is given from two
copies, one of them in the editor's folio MS., but
which contained very great variations), bears marks
of considerable antiquity, and, perhaps, ought to have
taken place of any in this volume. It would seem to have been
written while part of Spain was in the hands of the Saracens or
Moors: whose empire there was not fully extinguished before the
year 1491. The Mahometans are spoken of in v. 49, &amp;c., just in
the same terms as in all other old romances. The author of the
ancient Legend of <i>Sir Bevis</i> represents his hero, upon all occasions,
breathing out defiance against</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mahound and Termagaunte;"<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and so full of zeal for his religion, as to return the following polite
message to a Paynim king's fair daughter, who had fallen in love
with him, and sent two Saracen knights to invite him to her
bower,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I wyll not ones stirre off this grounde,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speake with an heathen hounde.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unchristen houndes, I rede you fle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or I your harte bloud shall se."<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Indeed they return the compliment by calling him elsewhere
"A christen hounde."<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p>

<p>This was conformable to the real manners of the barbarous
ages: perhaps the same excuse will hardly serve our bard, for that
Adland should be found lolling or leaning at his gate (v. 35) may
be thought, perchance, a little out of character. And yet the
great painter of manners, Homer, did not think it inconsistent
with decorum to represent a king of the Taphians leaning at the
gate of Ulysses to inquire for that monarch, when he touched at
Ithaca as he was taking a voyage with a ship's cargo of iron to
dispose in traffic.<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id="FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> So little ought we to judge of ancient manners
by our own.</p>

<p>Before I conclude this article, I cannot help observing, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>reader will see, in this ballad, the character of the old Minstrels
(those successors of the Bards) placed in a very respectable light:<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
here he will see one of them represented mounted on a fine horse,
accompanied with an attendant to bear his harp after him, and to
sing the poems of his composing. Here he will see him mixing
in the company of kings without ceremony: no mean proof of the
great antiquity of this poem. The farther we carry our inquiries
back, the greater respect we find paid to the professors of poetry
and music among all the Celtic and Gothic nations. Their
character was deemed so sacred, that under its sanction our famous
king Alfred (as we have already seen)<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> made no scruple to enter
the Danish camp, and was at once admitted to the king's headquarters.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a>
Our poet has suggested the same expedient to the
heroes of this ballad. All the histories of the North are full of the
great reverence paid to this order of men. Harold Harfagre, a
celebrated King of Norway, was wont to seat them at his table
above all the officers of his court: and we find another Norwegian
king placing five of them by his side in a day of battle, that they
might be eye-witnesses of the great exploits they were to celebrate.<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
As to Estmere's riding into the hall while the kings were at table,
this was usual in the ages of chivalry; and even to this day we see
a relic of this custom still kept up, in the champion's riding into
Westminster Hall during the coronation dinner.<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>Some liberties have been taken with this tale by the editor, but
none without notice to the reader in that part which relates to the
subject of the harper and his attendant.</p>

<p>[Percy refers to two copies of this ballad, but there is every
reason to believe that one of these was the bishop's own composition,
as it was never seen by others and has not since been
found. The copy from the folio MS. was torn out by Percy when
he was preparing the fourth edition of the <i>Reliques</i> for the press,
and is now unfortunately lost, so that we have no means of telling
what alterations he made in addition to those which he mentions
in the footnotes. The readings in the fourth edition are changed
in several places from those printed in the first edition.]</p></div>

<p>&#8258; The word <i>Gramary&egrave;</i>,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> which occurs several times in the
foregoing poem, is probably a corruption of the French word
<i>Grimoire</i>, which signifies a conjuring book in the old French
romances, if not the art of necromancy itself.</p>

<p>&dagger;&Dagger;&dagger; <i>Termagaunt</i> (mentioned above, p. <a href="#Page_85">85</a>) is the name given in
the old romances to the god of the Saracens, in which he is constantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>linked with <i>Mahound</i> or Mahomet. Thus, in the legend
of <i>Syr Guy</i>, the Soudan (Sultan), swears</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So helpe me <i>Mahowne</i> of might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And <i>Termagaunt</i> my god so bright."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Sign.</i> p. iii. b.</p>

<p>This word is derived by the very learned editor of Junius from
the Anglo-Saxon Ty&#775;&#xA783; very, and Ma&#x1D79;an mighty. As this word had
so sublime a derivation, and was so applicable to the true God,
how shall we account for its being so degraded? Perhaps Ty&#775;&#xA783;-ma&#7545;an
or <i>Termagant</i> had been a name originally given to some
Saxon idol, before our ancestors were converted to Christianity;
or had been the peculiar attribute of one of their false deities; and
therefore the first Christian missionaries rejected it as profane and
improper to be applied to the true God. Afterwards, when the
irruptions of the Saracens into Europe, and the Crusades into the
East, had brought them acquainted with a new species of unbelievers,
our ignorant ancestors, who thought all that did not receive
the Christian law were necessarily pagans and idolaters, supposed
the Mahometan creed was in all respects the same with that of
their pagan forefathers, and therefore made no scruple to give the
ancient name of <i>Termagant</i> to the god of the Saracens, just in the
same manner as they afterwards used the name of <i>Sarazen</i> to
express any kind of pagan or idolater. In the ancient romance
of <i>Merline</i> (in the editor's folio MS.) the Saxons themselves that
came over with Hengist, because they were not Christians, are
constantly called Sarazens.</p>

<p>However that be, it is certain that, after the times of the Crusades,
both <i>Mahound</i> and <i>Termagaunt</i> made their frequent appearance
in the pageants and religious interludes of the barbarous
ages; in which they were exhibited with gestures so furious and
frantic, as to become proverbial. Thus Skelton speaks of Wolsey:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Like <i>Mahound</i> in a play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man dare him withsay."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right">Ed. 1736, p. 158.</p>

<p>In like manner Bale, describing the threats used by some papist
magistrates to his wife, speaks of them as "grennyng upon her lyke
<i>Termagauntes</i> in a playe." (<i>Actes of Engl. Votaryes</i>, pt. ii. fo. 83,
Ed. 1550, 12mo.) Accordingly in a letter of Edward Alleyn, the
founder of Dulwich College, to his wife or sister, who, it seems,
with all her fellows (the players), had been "by my Lorde Maiors
officer[s] mad to rid in a cart," he expresses his concern that she
should "fall into the hands of suche <i>Tarmagants</i>." (So the orig.
dated May 2, 1593, preserved by the care of the Rev. Thomas
Jenyns Smith, Fellow of Dulw. Coll.) Hence we may conceive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the force of Hamlet's expression in Shakspeare, where, condemning
a ranting player, he says, "I could have such a fellow
whipt for ore-doing <i>Termagant</i>: it out-herods Herod" (Act iii.
sc. 3). By degrees the word came to be applied to an outrageous
turbulent person, and especially to a violent brawling woman; to
whom alone it is now confined, and this the rather as, I suppose,
the character of <i>Termagant</i> was anciently represented on the stage
after the eastern mode, with long robes or petticoats.</p>

<p>Another frequent character in the old pageants or interludes of
our ancestors, was the <i>sowdan</i> or <i>soldan</i>, representing a grim eastern
tyrant. This appears from a curious passage in Stow's <i>Annals</i>
(p. 458). In a stage-play "the people know right well that he
that plaieth the <i>sowdain</i>, is percase a sowter [shoe-maker]; yet if
one should cal him by his owne name, while he standeth in his
majestie, one of his tormenters might hap to break his head."
The <i>sowdain</i>, or <i>soldan</i>, was a name given to the Sarazen king
(being only a more rude pronunciation of the word <i>sultan</i>), as the
soldan of Egypt, the soudan of Persia, the sowdan of Babylon, &amp;c.,
who were generally represented as accompanied with grim Sarazens,
whose business it was to punish and torment Christians.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude this short memoir, without observing that the
French romancers, who had borrowed the word <i>Termagant</i> from us,
and applied it as we in their old romances, corrupted it into <i>Tervagaunte</i>;
and from them La Fontaine took it up, and has used it
more than once in his tales. This may be added to the other
proofs adduced in these volumes of the great intercourse that
formerly subsisted between the old minstrels and legendary writers
of both nations, and that they mutually borrowed each other's
romances.</p>

<h3>VII.<br />
<br />
SIR PATRICK SPENCE,</h3>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Scottish Ballad</span>,
</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0194.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">Is</span> given from two MS. copies transmitted from Scotland.
In what age the hero of this ballad lived, or when
this fatal expedition happened that proved so destructive
to the Scots nobles, I have not been able to discover;
yet am of opinion, that their catastrophe is not altogether
without foundation in history, though it has escaped my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
researches. In the infancy of navigation, such as used the northern
seas were very liable to shipwreck in the wintry months: hence
a law was enacted in the reign of James III. (a law which was
frequently repeated afterwards), "That there be na schip frauched
out of the realm with any staple gudes, fra the feast of Simons
day and Jude, unto the feast of the purification of our Lady called
Candelmess." <i>Jam. III. Parlt. 2, ch. 15.</i></p>

<p>In some modern copies, instead of Patrick Spence hath been
substituted the name of Sir Andrew Wood, a famous Scottish
admiral who flourished in the time of our Edward IV., but whose
story has nothing in common with this of the ballad. As Wood
was the most noted warrior of Scotland, it is probable that, like the
Theban Hercules, he hath engrossed the renown of other heroes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The fact that this glorious ballad was never heard of before
Percy printed it in 1765, caused some to throw doubts upon its
authenticity, and their scepticism was strengthened by the note at
p. 102, which refers to the author of <i>Hardyknute</i>. It was thought
that the likeness in expression and sentiment there mentioned
might easily be explained if the two poems were both by Lady
Wardlaw. This view, advocated by Robert Chambers in his general
attack on the authenticity of all <i>The Romantic Scottish Ballads</i>
(1859), has not met with much favour, and Professor Child thinks
that the arguments against the genuineness of <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i>
are so trivial as hardly to admit of statement. He writes, "If not
ancient it has been always accepted as such by the most skilful
judges, and is a solitary instance of a successful imitation in manner
and spirit of the best specimens of authentic minstrelsy."<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Coleridge,
no mean judge of a ballad, wrote&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The bard be sure was weather-wise who framed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grand old ballad of Sir Patrick Spens."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Antiquaries have objected that Spence is not an early Scottish
name, but in this they are wrong, for Professor Aytoun found it
in a charter of Robert III. and also in Wyntoun's <i>Chronicle</i>.</p>

<p>There has been considerable discussion as to the historical event
referred to in the ballad, and the present version does not contain
any mention of one of the points that may help towards a settlement
of the question. The version in Scott's <i>Minstrelsy</i> contains
the following stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To Noroway, to Noroway<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To Noroway o'er the faem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king's daughter of Noroway<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis thou maun bring her hame."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>
<p>Professor Aytoun would change the third line to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The king's daughter <i>to</i> Noroway,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>as he agrees with Motherwell in the view that the ballad refers to
the fate of the Scottish nobles who in 1281 conveyed Margaret,
daughter of Alexander III., to Norway, on the occasion of her
nuptials with King Eric.</p>

<p>Fordun relates this incident as follows:&mdash;"In the year 1281
Margaret, daughter of Alexander III., was married to the King of
Norway, who, leaving Scotland in the last day of July, was conveyed
thither in noble style in company with many knights and
nobles. In returning home after the celebration of her nuptials,
the Abbot of Balmerinoch, Bernard of Monte-alto, and many other
persons, were drowned." As to the scene of the disaster, Aytoun
brings forward an interesting illustration of the expression "half
over to Aberdour," in line 41. He says that in the little island of
Papa Stronsay one of the Orcadian group lying over against Norway,
there is a large grave or tumulus which has been known to
the inhabitants from time immemorial as "the grave of Sir Patrick
Spens," and he adds, that as the Scottish ballads were not early
current in Orkney, it is unlikely that the poem originated the
name.</p>

<p>The other suggestions as to an historical basis for the ballad are
not borne out by history. It is well, however, to note in illustration
of line 1, that the Scottish kings chiefly resided in their palace
of Dunfermline from the time of Malcolm Canmore to that of
Alexander III.</p>

<p>The present copy of the ballad is the shortest of the various
versions, but this is not a disadvantage, as it gains much in force
by the directness of its language.</p>

<p>Buchan prints a ballad called <i>Young Allan</i>, which is somewhat
like <i>Sir Patrick Spence</i>.]</p></div>

ROBIN HOOD AND GUY OF GISBORNE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0198.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">We</span> have here a ballad of Robin Hood (from the editor's
folio MS.) which was never before printed, and carries
marks of much greater antiquity than any of the common
popular songs on this subject.</p>

<p>The severity of those tyrannical forest laws that were introduced
by our Norman kings, and the great temptation of breaking
them by such as lived near the royal forests at a time when
the yeomanry of this kingdom were everywhere trained up to
the long-bow, and excelled all other nations in the art of shooting,
must constantly have occasioned great numbers of outlaws,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>and especially of such as were the best marksmen. These naturally
fled to the woods for shelter, and, forming into troops, endeavoured
by their numbers to protect themselves from the dreadful
penalties of their delinquency. The ancient punishment for
killing the king's deer was loss of eyes and castration, a punishment
far worse than death. This will easily account for the troops
of banditti which formerly lurked in the royal forests, and, from
their superior skill in archery and knowledge of all the recesses of
those unfrequented solitudes, found it no difficult matter to resist
or elude the civil power.</p>

<p>Among all those, none was ever more famous than the hero of
this ballad, whose chief residence was in Shirewood forest, in Nottinghamshire,
and the heads of whose story, as collected by Stow,
are briefly these.</p>

<p>"In this time [about the year 1190, in the reign of Richard I.]
were many robbers, and outlawes, among the which Robin Hood,
and Little John, renowned theeves, continued in woods, despoyling
and robbing the goods of the rich. They killed none but such as
would invade them; or by resistance for their own defence.</p>

<p>"The saide Robert entertained an hundred tall men and good
archers with such spoiles and thefts as he got, upon whom four
hundred (were they ever so strong) durst not give the onset. He
suffered no woman to be oppressed, violated, or otherwise molested:
poore mens goods he spared, abundantlie relieving them with that
which by theft he got from abbeys and the houses of rich carles:
whom Maior (the historian) blameth for his rapine and theft, but
of all theeves he affirmeth him to be the prince, and the most gentle
theefe."&mdash;<i>Annals</i>, p. 159.</p>

<p>The personal courage of this celebrated outlaw, his skill in
archery, his humanity, and especially his levelling principle of
taking from the rich and giving to the poor, have in all ages rendered
him the favourite of the common people, who, not content
to celebrate his memory by innumerable songs and stories, have
erected him into the dignity of an earl. Indeed, it is not impossible
but our hero, to gain the more respect from his followers,
or they to derive the more credit to their profession, may have
given rise to such a report themselves: for we find it recorded in
an epitaph, which, if genuine, must have been inscribed on his
tombstone near the nunnery of Kirklees in Yorkshire; where (as
the story goes) he was bled to death by a treacherous nun to
whom he applied for phlebotomy:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>This epitaph appears to me suspicious; however, a late antiquary
has given a pedigree of <i>Robin Hood</i>, which, if genuine,
shows that he had real pretensions to the Earldom of Huntingdon,
and that his true name was <i>Robert Fitz-ooth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> Yet the most
ancient poems on Robin Hood make no mention of this earldom.
He is expressly asserted to have been a yeoman<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> in a very old
legend in verse, preserved in the archives of the public library at
Cambridge,<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> in eight <i>fyttes</i>, or parts, printed in black letter, quarto,
thus inscribed: "&para; Here begynneth a lytell geste of Robyn hode
and his meyne, and of the proude sheryfe of Notyngham." The
first lines are&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>The printer's colophon is, "&para; Explicit Kinge Edwarde and
Robin hode and Lyttel Johan. Enprented at London in Flete-strete
at the sygne of the sone by Wynkin de Worde." In Mr.
Garrick's Collection<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> is a different edition of the same poem,
"&para; Imprinted at London upon the thre Crane wharfe by Wyllyam
Copland," containing at the end a little dramatic piece on the subject
of Robin Hood and the Friar, not found in the former copy,
called, "A newe playe for to be played in Maye games very
plesaunte and full of pastyme. &para;(&there4;)&#8267;."</p>

<p>I shall conclude these preliminary remarks with observing, that
the hero of this ballad was the favourite subject of popular songs
so early as the time of King Edward III. In the <i>Visions of Pierce</i>
<i>Plowman</i>, written in that reign, a monk says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

story, which shows what respect was shown to the
memory of our archer in the time of that prelate.</p>

this celebrated outlaw, in Sir John Hawkins's <i>Hist. of Music</i>,

for a robbery on Arbor-hill, Dublin (with some curious particulars
relating to his skill in archery), see Mr. J. C. Walker's ingenious

in this edition, hath been brought nearer to the folio MS.</p>

<p>[Robin Hood is first mentioned in literature in <i>Piers Plowman</i>,
the earliest of the three forms of which poem was written probably
about the year 1362. The ballad of <i>Robin Hood and the Monk</i>,
printed in Child's <i>English and Scottish Ballads</i>, as the oldest of
its class, and possibly as old as the reign of Edward II., commences:&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Verses which bear a strong likeness to the opening lines of the
present ballad.</p>

<p>Gisborne is a market town in the West Riding of the county of
York on the borders of Lancashire, and Guy of that place is mentioned
by William Dunbar in a satirical piece on "Schir Thomas
Nory," where he is named in company with Adam Bell and other
well-known worthies.</p>

<p>It is not needful to extend this note with any further particulars
of Robin Hood, as he possesses, in virtue of his position as a
popular hero, a literature of his own. Those who wish to know
more of his exploits should consult Ritson's (1795) and Gutch's
(1847) Collections of <i>Robin Hood Ballads</i>, Child's <i>Ballads</i>, vol. v. and
Chappell's <i>Popular Music of the Olden Time</i>, vol. i. pp. 387-400.</p>

<p>There are several Robin Hood Ballads in the folio MS., but
Percy only chose the one containing an account of the encounter
with Guy for printing. Ritson copied this ballad from Percy's
book, but indulged at the same time in a tirade against the bishop's
treatment of his original.]</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_551_551" id="Footnote_551_551"></a><a href="#FNanchor_551_551"><span class="label">[551]</span></a> The common epithet for a sword or other offensive weapon,
in the old metrical romances is <i>Brown</i>, as "brown brand," or
"brown sword," "brown bill," &amp;c., and sometimes even "bright
brown sword." Chaucer applies the word <i>rustie</i> in the same sense;
thus he describes the reve:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And by his side he bare a rusty blade."<br /></span>


<span class="i0"><i>Prol.</i> ver. 620.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
And even thus the God <i>Mars</i>:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And in his hand he had a rousty sword."<br /></span>


<span class="i0"><i>Test. of Cressid.</i> 188<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Spenser has sometimes used the same epithet. See Warton's
<i>Observ.</i> vol. ii. p. 62. It should seem, from this particularity, that
our ancestors did not pique themselves upon keeping their weapons
bright: perhaps they deemed it more honourable to carry them
stained with the blood of their enemies. [As the swords are here
said to be bright as well as brown, they could not have been
rusty. The expression nut-brown sword was used to designate a
Damascus blade.]</p></div>

<h3>IX.<br />
<br />
AN ELEGY ON HENRY FOURTH EARL
OF NORTHUMBERLAND.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0213.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of this poem, which was written by <i>Skelton</i>,
is the death of <i>Henry Percy</i>, fourth earl of Northumberland,
who fell a victim to the avarice of Henry VII. In
1489 the parliament had granted the king a subsidy for
carrying on the war in Bretagne. This tax was found so heavy in
the North, that the whole country was in a flame. The E. of Northumberland,
then lord lieutenant for Yorkshire, wrote to inform the
king of the discontent, and praying an abatement. But nothing is
so unrelenting as avarice: the king wrote back that not a penny
should be abated. This message being delivered by the earl with
too little caution, the populace rose, and, supposing him to be the
promoter of their calamity, broke into his house, and murdered him,
with several of his attendants, who yet are charged by Skelton with
being backward in their duty on this occasion. This melancholy
event happened at the earl's seat at Cocklodge, near Thirske, in
Yorkshire, April 28, 1489. See Lord Bacon, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If the reader does not find much poetical merit in this old poem
(which yet is one of Skelton's best), he will see a striking picture of
the state and magnificence kept up by our ancient nobility during
the feudal times. This great earl is described here as having, among
his menial servants, <i>knights</i>, <i>squires</i>, and even <i>barons</i>: see v. 32.
183. &amp;c. which, however different from modern manners, was formerly
not unusual with our greater barons, whose castles had all the
splendour and offices of a royal court before the laws against retainers
abridged and limited the number of their attendants.</p>

<p><i>John Skelton</i>, who commonly styled himself Poet Laureat, died
June 21, 1529. The following poem, which appears to have been
written soon after the event, is printed from an ancient MS. copy
preserved in the British Museum, being much more correct than
that printed among <i>Skelton's Poems</i> in bl. let. 12mo. 1568.&mdash;It is
addressed to Henry Percy, fifth earl of Northumberland, and is prefaced,
&amp;c. in the following manner:</p>

<p>[Percy does not do justice to Skelton's poetical powers in the
above note, as this <i>Elegy</i> is written in a style not at all characteristic
of him and is also far from being one of his best poems. Skelton
was one of the earliest personal satirists in our language, and he flew
at high game when he attacked the powerful Wolsey with fierce
invective, in his "Why come ye nat to courte?" His <i>Boke of</i>
<i>Phyllyp Sparrowe</i> is described by Coleridge as "an exquisite and
original poem," and its subject entitles him to the designation of the
modern Catullus. It was very popular in his day, and the nursery
rhyme of <i>Who killed Cock robin?</i> was probably paraphrased
from the portion of the poem in which the funeral of the sparrow
is related. Skelton was a distinguished scholar and his earlier
poems are written in the serious strain of the <i>Elegy</i>, but curiously
enough about the time that he took orders (1498) and became rector
of Diss in Norfolk, he began to write in a more natural, frolicsome
and satirical vein, and adopted the metre now known as Skeltonian.
He was not very particular as to the words he used, but he does
not deserve the opprobrious epithet that Pope applies to him in the
couplet&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Skelton graduated as poet laureate at the two Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, and the King allowed him to wear an
appropriate decoration at court. There is a full length portrait of
the poet in Brydges' <i>British Bibliographer</i> (vol. iv. p. 389), taken
from one on the back of the title of <i>A ryght delectable tratyse upon</i>
<i>a goodly Garlande or Chaplet of Laurell by Mayster Skelton, Poete</i>

THE TOWER OF DOCTRINE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0223.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> reader has here a specimen of the descriptive powers
of <i>Stephen Hawes</i>, a celebrated poet in the reign of
Hen. VII. tho' now little known. It is extracted from
an allegorical poem of his (written in 1505.) intitled,
<i>The History of Graunde Amoure and La Bel Pucell, called the</i>
<i>Pastime of Pleasure, &amp;c.</i> 4to. 1555. See more of Hawes in <i>Ath.</i>
<i>Ox.</i> v. 1. p. 6. and Warton's <i>Observ.</i> v. 2. p. 105. He was also
author of a book, intitled, <i>The Temple of Glass. Wrote by Stephen</i>
<i>Hawes, gentleman of the bedchamber to K. Henry VII.</i> Pr. for Caxton,
4to. no date.</p>

<p>The following Stanzas are taken from Chap. III. and IV. of the
Hist. above-mentioned. "How Fame departed from Graunde
Amoure and left him with Governaunce and Grace, and how he
went to the Tower of Doctrine, &amp;c."&mdash;As we are able to give no
small lyric piece of Hawes's, the reader will excuse the insertion of
this extract.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Most readers will probably be satisfied with the seventy-four lines
that Percy has extracted from Hawes's long didactic poem, but
those who wish to read the whole will find it reprinted by Mr. Thomas
Wright in the fifteenth volume of the Percy Society's publications.
The account of Rhetorick and the other allegorical nullities is weary
reading, but the chapter in commendation of Gower, Chaucer and
the author's master Lydgate, "the chefe orygynal of my lernyng,"
is interesting from a literary point of view. The poem was very
popular in its own day and passed through several editions, and it
has found admirers among critics of a later age. The Rev. Dr.
Hodgson in a letter to Percy, dated Sept. 22, 1800,<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> speaks of it
in very extravagant terms, and regrets that it had not then found
an editor, as he regarded it "as one of the finest poems in our own
or any other language." Warton describes Hawes as the only writer
deserving the name of a poet in the reign of Henry VII. and says
that "this poem contains no common touches of romantic and
allegoric fiction." Mr. Wright however looks at it as "one of those
allegorical writings which were popular with our forefathers, but
which can now only be looked upon as monuments of the bad taste
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>of a bad age." Hawes was a native of Suffolk, but the dates of his
birth and death are not known. He studied in the University of
Oxford and afterwards travelled much, becoming "a complete
master of the French and Italian poetry."]</p></div>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">Is</span> given from a fragment in the Editor's folio MS. which,
tho' extremely defective and mutilated, appeared to have
so much merit, that it excited a strong desire to attempt
a completion of the story. The Reader will easily discover
the supplemental stanzas by their inferiority, and at the same
time be inclined to pardon it, when he considers how difficult it
must be to imitate the affecting simplicity and artless beauties of
the original.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The <i>Child of Ell</i>, as it appears in the folio MS., is a fragment
without beginning or ending, so that Percy was forced to add some
verses in order to fit it for his book, but the above note does not
give any adequate notion of his contributions to the ballad. The
verses that are entirely due to the bishop's pen are placed between
brackets, and it will be seen from the copy of the original printed
at the end that the remaining thirty lines are much altered from it.
It is unfortunate that Percy's taste was not sufficient to save him
from adding sentimental verses so out of character with the directness
of the original as&mdash;</p></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0236.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Was</span> printed at Glasgow, by Robert and Andrew Foulis,
MDCCLV. 8vo. 12 pages. We are indebted for its
publication (with many other valuable things in these
volumes) to Sir David Dalrymple, Bart., who gave it as
it was preserved in the memory of a lady that is now dead.</p>

<p>The reader will here find it improved and enlarged with several
fine stanzas, recovered from a fragment of the same ballad, in the
Editor's folio MS. It is remarkable that the latter is entitled
<i>Captain Adam Carre</i>, and is in the English idiom. But whether
the author was English or Scotch, the difference originally was not
great. The English Ballads are generally of the North of England,
the Scottish are of the South of Scotland, and of consequence the
country of ballad-singers was sometimes subject to one crown, and
sometimes to the other, and most frequently to neither. Most of the
finest old Scotch songs have the scene laid within twenty miles of
England, which is indeed all poetic ground, green hills, remains
of woods, clear brooks. The pastoral scenes remain: of the rude
chivalry of former ages happily nothing remains but the ruins of
the castles, where the more daring and successful robbers resided.
The house or castle of the <i>Rodes</i> stood about a measured mile
south from Duns, in Berwickshire: some of the ruins of it may be
seen to this day. The <i>Gordons</i> were anciently seated in the same
county: the two villages of East and West Gordon lie about
ten miles from the castle of the Rodes.<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> The fact, however, on
which the ballad is founded, happened in the north of Scotland,<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>yet it is but too faithful a specimen of the violences practised in
the feudal times in every part of this Island, and indeed all over
Europe.</p>

<p>From the different titles of this ballad, it should seem that the
old strolling bards or minstrels (who gained a livelihood by reciting
these poems) made no scruple of changing the names of the personages
they introduced, to humour their hearers. For instance,
if a Gordon's conduct was blameworthy in the opinion of that age,
the obsequious minstrel would, when among Gordons, change the
name to Car, whose clan or sept lay further west, and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.
The foregoing observation, which I owed to Sir David Dalrymple,
will appear the more perfectly well founded, if, as I have since
been informed (from <i>Crawford's Memoirs</i>), the principal Commander
of the expedition was a <i>Gordon</i>, and the immediate agent
a <i>Car</i>, or <i>Ker</i>; for then the reciter might, upon good grounds, impute
the barbarity here deplored, either to a Gordon or a Car, as
best suited his purpose. In the third volume the reader will find
a similar instance. See the song of <i>Gil Morris</i>, wherein the principal
character introduced had different names given him, perhaps
from the same cause.</p>

<p>It may be proper to mention that, in the folio MS., instead
of the "Castle of the Rodes," it is the "Castle of Bittons-borrow,"
and also "Dractons-borrow," and "Capt. Adam Carre"
is called the "Lord of Westerton-town." Uniformity required
that the additional stanzas supplied from that copy should be
clothed in the Scottish orthography and idiom: this has therefore
been attempted, though perhaps imperfectly.</p>

<p>[Percy's note, which goes to prove that the historical event referred
to in this ballad occurred in the north of Scotland, negatives
the view which is expressed just before, that the borders are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>exclusive country of the ballad singers, at all events in this particular
instance. Sir David Dalrymple appears to have altered the
place of action from Towie to Rodes under a misconception. An
extract from <i>Crawford's Memoirs</i> (an. 1571, p. 240, ed. 1706), is
a proper companion to the passage from Spotswood, and explains
the title in the folio MS. The person sent was "one Captain Ker
with a party of foot.... Nor was he ever so much as cashiered
for this inhuman action, which made Gordon share in the scandal
and the guilt." Gordon, in his <i>History of the Family of Gordon</i>,
informs us that, in the true old spirit of Scottish family feuds, the
Forbes's afterwards attempted to assassinate Gordon in the streets
of Paris.</p>

<p>Percy showed good taste in rejecting the termination given in
Dalrymple's version, which certainly does not improve the ballad,
and has moreover a very modern flavour. The husband is there
made to end his days as follows:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And round and round the wa's he went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their ashes for to view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last into the flames he flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bad the world adieu."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This ballad is found in various versions, which proves how wide-spread
was the popularity of the striking story which it relates. In
the version given from the Cotton MS. by Ritson in his <i>Ancient</i>
<i>Songs</i> (vol. ii. p. 38, ed. 1829) the husband takes no vengeance on
Captain Car. Another version, entitled <i>Loudoun Castle</i>, is reprinted
in <i>Child's English and Scottish Ballads</i> (vol. vi. p. 254), from the
<i>Ballads and Songs of Ayrshire</i>, where the scene is changed to
Loudoun Castle, which is supposed to have been burnt about three
hundred and sixty years ago by the clan Kennedy. In Ritson's
version the castle is called Crechcrynbroghe, and in the <i>Genealogy</i>
<i>of the Forbes</i>, by Matthew Lumsden, of Tullikerne, written in 1580
(Inverness, 1819, p. 44), the name is changed to Cargaffe. From
this latter source we learn that the lady of Towie was Margaret
Campbell, daughter of Sir John Campbell, of Calder, and that
the husband, far from flying into the flames, married a second wife, a
daughter of Forbes of Reires, who bare him a son named Arthur.]</p></div>

intitled <i>Adam O'Gordon</i>. It may be observed, that the famous
freebooter whom Edward I. fought with, hand to hand, near
Farnham, was named <i>Adam Gordon</i>.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_648_648" id="Footnote_648_648"></a><a href="#FNanchor_648_648"><span class="label">[648]</span></a> Since this ballad was first printed, the subject of it has been
found recorded in Abp. Spotswood's <i>History of the Church of</i>
<i>Scotland</i>, p. 259, who informs us that,
"Anno 1571. In the north parts of Scotland, <i>Adam Gordon</i>
(who was deputy for his brother the earl of Huntley) did keep a
great stir; and under colour of the queen's authority, committed
divers oppressions, especially upon the Forbes's.... Having
killed Arthur Forbes, brother to the lord Forbes.... Not long
after he sent to summon the house of Tavoy pertaining to Alexander
Forbes. The <i>Lady</i> refusing to yield without direction from
her husband, he put fire unto it, and burnt her therein, with children
and servants, being twenty-seven persons in all.
</p>
<p>
"This inhuman and barbarous cruelty made his name odious,
and stained all his former doings; otherwise he was held very active
and fortunate in his enterprizes."
</p>
<p>
This fact, which had escaped the Editor's notice, was in the
most obliging manner pointed out to him by an ingenious writer
who signs his name H. H. (Newcastle, May 9) in the <i>Gentleman's</i>
<i>Magazine</i> for May, 1775.</p></div>

<p>Our great dramatic poet having occasionally quoted
many ancient ballads, and even taken the plot of one,
if not more, of his plays from among them, it was judged
proper to preserve as many of these as could be recovered,
and, that they might be the more easily found,
to exhibit them in one collective view. This Second
Book is therefore set apart for the reception of such
ballads as are quoted by Shakespeare, or contribute in
any degree to illustrate his writings: this being the principal
point in view, the candid reader will pardon the
admission of some pieces that have no other kind of
merit.</p>

</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Were</span> three noted outlaws, whose skill in archery rendered
them formerly as famous in the north of England, as
Robin Hood and his fellows were in the midland counties.
Their place of residence was in the forest of Englewood,
not far from Carlisle (called corruptly in the ballad Englishwood,
whereas Engle, or Ingle-wood, signifies wood for firing). At
what time they lived does not appear. The author of the common
ballad on "The Pedigree, Education and Marriage of Robin Hood,"
makes them contemporary with Robin Hood's father, in order to
give him the honour of beating them, viz.:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The father of Robin a Forester was,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and he shot in a lusty long-bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two north-country miles and an inch at a shot,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">as the Pinder of Wakefield does know:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For he brought Adam Bell, and Clim of the Clugh,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and William a Clowd&eacute;slee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shoot with our Forester for forty mark;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and the Forester beat them all three."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Collect. of Old Ballads</i>, vol. i. (1723), p. 67.</p>

<p>This seems to prove that they were commonly thought to have
lived before the popular hero of Sherwood.</p>

<p>Our northern archers were not unknown to their southern
countrymen: their excellence at the long-bow is often alluded to
by our ancient poets. Shakespeare, in his comedy of <i>Much adoe</i>
<i>about nothing</i>, act i., makes Benedick confirm his resolves of
not yielding to love, by this protestation, "If I do, hang me in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
bottle like a cat,<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> and shoot at me, and he that hits me, let him be
clapt on the shoulder, and called <i>Adam</i>:" meaning <i>Adam Bell</i>, as
Theobald rightly observes, who refers to one or two other passages
in our old poets wherein he is mentioned. The Oxford editor has
also well conjectured, that "Abraham Cupid" in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>,
act ii. sc. 1, should be "<i>Adam</i> Cupid," in allusion to our archer.
Ben Jonson has mentioned <i>Clym o' the Clough</i> in his <i>Alchemist</i>,
act i. sc. 2. And Sir William Davenant, in a mock poem of his,
called "<i>The long vacation in London</i>," describes the Attorneys and
Proctors, as making matches to meet in Finsbury fields.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With loynes in canvas bow-case tyde:<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where arrowes stick with mickle pride; ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like ghosts of <i>Adam Bell</i> and <i>Clymme</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sol sets for fear they'l shoot at him."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right"><i>Works</i>, 1673, fol. p. 291.</p>

<p>I have only to add further concerning the principal hero of this
Ballad, that the <i>Bells</i> were noted rogues in the North so late as the
time of Q. Elizabeth. See in Rymer's <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, a letter from lord
William Howard to some of the officers of state, wherein he
mentions them.</p>

<p>As for the following stanzas, which will be judged from the style,
orthography, and numbers, to be of considerable antiquity, they were
here given (corrected in some places by a MS. copy in the Editor's
old folio) from a black-letter 4to. <i>Imprinted at London in Lothburye</i>
<i>by Wyllyam Copland</i> (no date). That old quarto edition seems to
be exactly followed in <i>Pieces of Ancient Popular Poetry, &amp;c.</i> Lond.
1791,<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> 8vo., the variations from which that occur in the following
copy, are selected from many others in the folio MS. above-mentioned,
and when distinguished by the usual inverted 'comma,'
have been assisted by conjecture.</p>

<p>In the same MS. this Ballad is followed by another, intitled
<i>Younge Cloudeslee</i>, being a continuation of the present story, and
reciting the adventures of Willian of Cloudesly's son: but greatly
inferior to this both in merit and antiquity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The version here printed differs but slightly from the one in the
Folio MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall, 1868, vol. iii. p. 76), and as
the latter is of no critical value it has been thought unnecessary to
point out the various readings. A fragment of an older edition
than Copland's mentioned above has been recovered by Mr. Payne
Collier, which is attributed to the press of Wynkyn de Worde by
Mr. W. C. Hazlitt.</p>

<p>This spirited ballad is mentioned by Laneham in his Catalogue
of Captain Cox's ballads, and the various editions it has passed
through, and the frequent references to it in literature, prove its
great and deserved popularity.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the second Fit resemble closely the rescue
of Robin Hood by Little John, as related in "Robin Hood and
the Monk," and the incident of the shot at the apple in the third
Fit bears a curious likeness to the very ancient myth which is
associated with William Tell. "Allane Bell" is mentioned by
Dunbar in company with Robin Hood, Guy of Gisborne, and
others, which proves that in his time these names had become
mere abstractions.]</p></div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> Grave-digger's song in <i>Hamlet</i>, act v. is taken from
three stanzas of the following poem, though greatly
altered and disguised, as the same were corrupted by the
ballad-singers of Shakespeare's time; or perhaps so designed
by the poet himself, the better to suit the character of an illiterate
clown. The original is preserved among Surrey's Poems, and
is attributed to Lord <i>Vaux</i>, by George Gascoigne, who tells us, it
"was thought by some to be made upon his death-bed;" a popular
error which he laughs at. (See his <i>Epist. to Yong Gent.</i> prefixed
to his <i>Posies</i>, 1575, 4to.) It is also ascribed to Lord Vaux in a
manuscript copy preserved in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> This Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>was remarkable for his skill in drawing feigned manners, &amp;c. for
so I understand an ancient writer. "The Lord Vaux his commendation
lyeth chiefly in the facilitie of his meetre, and the aptnesse
of his descriptions such as he taketh upon him to make,
namely in sundry of his Songs, wherein he showeth the <i>counterfait</i>
<i>action</i> very lively and pleasantly." <i>Arte of Eng. Poesie</i>, 1589,
p. 51. See another <i>Song</i> by this Poet in vol. ii. No. viii.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Thomas second Lord Vaux, the author of this poem, was born
in the year 1510. He wrote several small pieces of the same
character which evince taste and feeling, and his contributions to
the <i>Paradise of Dainty Devices</i> exceed in number those of Richard
Edwards himself, whose name appears upon the original title-page
as the chief author. Lord Vaux was a courtier as well as a poet,
and was one of the splendid retinue which attended Wolsey in his
embassy, in the 19th Henry VIII., 1527, to the Court of France
to negotiate a peace. He took his seat in the House of Lords in
the 22nd Henry VIII., and two years afterwards, 1532, waited on
the king to Calais and thence to Boulogne. He was rewarded with
the Order of the Bath at the Coronation of Anne Boleyn, and was
also appointed Captain of the Island of Jersey, which office he
surrendered in the 28th Henry VIII.]</p></div>

JEPHTHAH JUDGE OF ISRAEL.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0278.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i>, act ii. the hero of the play takes
occasion to banter Polonius with some scraps of an old
Ballad, which has never appeared yet in any collection:
for which reason, as it is but short, it will not perhaps
be unacceptable to the reader; who will also be diverted with the
pleasant absurdities of the composition. It was retrieved from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>utter oblivion by a lady, who wrote it down from memory as she
had formerly heard it sung by her father. I am indebted for it to
the friendship of Mr. <i>Steevens</i>.</p>

<p>It has been said, that the original Ballad, in black-letter, is
among Anthony &agrave; Wood's Collections in the Ashmolean Museum.
But, upon application lately made, the volume which contained this
Song was missing, so that it can only now be given as in the former
Edition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Banter of Hamlet is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>Hamlet.</i> 'O Jeptha, Judge of Israel,' what a treasure hadst
thou?</p>

<p><i>Polonius.</i> What a treasure had he, my Lord?</p>

<p><i>Ham.</i> Why, 'One faire daughter, and no more, the which
he loved passing well.'</p>

<p><i>Polon.</i> Still on my daughter.</p>

<p><i>Ham.</i> Am not I i' th' right, old Jeptha?</p>

<p><i>Polon.</i> If you call me Jeptha, my Lord, I have a daughter,
that I love passing well.</p>

<p><i>Ham.</i> Nay, that follows not.</p>

<p><i>Polon.</i> What follows then, my Lord?</p>

<p><i>Ham.</i> Why, 'As by lot, God wot:' and then you know, 'It came
to passe, As most like it was.' The first row of the pious chanson
will shew you more."&mdash;<i>Act</i> ii. <i>sc.</i> 2.</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[A more perfect copy of this ballad was reprinted by Evans in
his <i>Collection of Old Ballads</i> from a black-letter broadside, and
is included by Child in his <i>Collection of English and Scottish</i>
<i>Ballads</i> (vol. viii. p. 198).</p>

<p>The wording is rather different in the two versions, and Evans's
has two additional stanzas. It does not appear that anything is
left out at line 18 of Percy's version, but in place of the stars at
line 41 Evans's copy reads&mdash;</p></div>

A ROBYN JOLLY ROBYN.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0281.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> his <i>Twelfth Night</i>, Shakespeare introduces the clown
singing part of the two first stanzas of the following Song;
which has been recovered from an antient MS. of Dr.
Harrington's at Bath, preserved among the many literary
treasures transmitted to the ingenious and worthy possessor by a
long line of most respectable ancestors. Of these only a small part
hath been printed in the <i>Nug&aelig; Antiqu&aelig;</i>, 3 vols. 12mo; a work
which the publick impatiently wishes to see continued.</p>

<p>The song is thus given by Shakespeare, act iv. sc. 2:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Clown.</i> 'Hey Robin, jolly Robin. [singing.]<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Tell me how thy lady does.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Malvolio.</i> Fool&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Clown.</i> 'My lady is unkind, perdy.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Malvolio.</i> Fool&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Clown.</i> 'Alas, why is she so?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Malvolio.</i> Fool, I say&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Clown.</i> 'She loves another.'&mdash;Who calls, ha?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dr. <i>Farmer</i> has conjectured that the song should begin thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hey, jolly Robin, tell to me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How does thy lady do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lady is unkind perdy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Alas, why is she so?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But this ingenious emendation is now superseded by the proper
readings of the old song itself, which is here printed from what appears
the most ancient of Dr. Harrington's poetical MSS. and which
has, therefore, been marked No. I. (Scil. p. 68.) That volume
seems to have been written in the reign of King Henry VIII. and,
as it contains many of the Poems of Sir <i>Thomas Wyat</i>, hath had
almost all the contents attributed to him by marginal directions
written with an old but later hand, and not always rightly, as, I
think, might be made appear by other good authorities. Among
the rest this song is there attributed to Sir <i>Thomas Wyat</i> also; but
the discerning reader will probably judge it to belong to a more
obsolete writer.</p>

<p>In the old MS. to the 3rd and 5th stanzas is prefixed this title,
<i>Responce</i>, and to the 4th and 6th, <i>Le Plaintif</i>; but in the last instance
so evidently wrong, that it was thought better to omit these
titles, and to mark the changes of the Dialogue by inverted commas.
In other respects the MS. is strictly followed, except where noted
in the margin.&mdash;Yet the first stanza appears to be defective, and it
should seem that a line is wanting, unless the four first words were
lengthened in the tune.</p>

A SONG TO THE LUTE IN MUSICKE.</h3>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> sonnet (which is ascribed to <i>Richard Edwards</i>,<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> in
the <i>Paradise of Daintie Devises</i>, fo. 31, b.) is by Shakespeare
made the subject of some pleasant ridicule in his
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, act iv. sc. 5, where he introduces Peter
putting this question to the musicians.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>Peter</i> ... why 'Silver Sound?' why 'Musicke with her silver
sound?' what say you, Simon Catling?</p>

<p><i>I. Mus.</i> Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
<p><i>Pet.</i> Pretty! what say you, Hugh Rebecke?</p>

<p><i>2. Mus.</i> I say, silver sound, because musicians sound for silver.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> Pretty too! what say you, James Sound-post.</p>

<p><i>3. Mus.</i> Faith, I know not what to say.</p>

<p><i>Pet.</i> ... I will say for you: It is 'Musicke with her silver
sound,' because musicians have no gold for sounding."</p></div>

<p>This ridicule is not so much levelled at the song itself (which for
the time it was written is not inelegant) as at those forced and unnatural
explanations often given by us painful editors and expositors
of ancient authors.</p>

<p>This copy is printed from an old quarto MS. in the Cotton
Library (Vesp. A. 25), intitled, "Divers things of Hen. viij's time:"
with some corrections from <i>The Paradise of Dainty Devises</i>, 1596.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Richard Edwards, one of the chief contributors to the <i>Paradise</i>
<i>of Dainty Devises</i>, was a facile and elegant poet much appreciated
by his contemporaries but unjustly neglected now. Meres in his
<i>Wits Treasury</i>, 1598, praises him, as "one of the best for comedy,"
and Puttenham gives him the same commendation. Thomas
Twyne and George Turberville, wrote epitaphs upon him, and the
latter says in the terms of unmeasured eulogy then fashionable&mdash;</p></div>

<p>Edwards was born in Somersetshire about 1523, was educated
at Oxford, and, in 1561, was constituted by Queen Elizabeth a
Gentleman of the Royal Chapel and Master of the Singing Boys
there. He attended the Queen on her visit to Oxford in 1566, and
was employed to compose a play called <i>Palamon and Arcite</i>, which
was acted before her Majesty in Christ Church Hall.]</p></div>

KING COPHETUA AND THE BEGGAR-MAID</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0285.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">Is</span> a story often alluded to by our old Dramatic Writers.
Shakespeare, in his <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, act ii. sc. 1, makes
Mercutio say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----"Her (Venus's) purblind son and heir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Adam<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> Cupid, he that shot so true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>As the 13th line of the following ballad seems here particularly
alluded to, it is not improbable but Shakespeare wrote it <i>shot so</i>
<i>trim</i>, which the players or printers, not perceiving the allusion, might
alter to <i>true</i>. The former, as being the more humorous expression,
seems most likely to have come from the mouth of Mercutio.<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the 2d Part of <i>Hen. IV.</i> A. 5, Sc. 3, Falstaff is introduced
affectedly saying to Pistoll,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let king Cophetua know the truth thereof."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These lines, Dr. Warburton thinks, were taken from an old bombast
play of <i>King Cophetua</i>. No such play is, I believe, now to be
found; but it does not therefore follow that it never existed. Many
dramatic pieces are referred to by old writers,<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> which are not now
extant, or even mentioned in any list. In the infancy of the stage,
plays were often exhibited that were never printed.</p>

<p>It is probably in allusion to the same play that Ben Jonson says,
in his Comedy of <i>Every Man in his Humour</i>, A. 3, Sc. 4:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have not the heart to devour thee, an' I might be made as
<i>rich</i> as King Cophetua."</p></div>

<p>At least there is no mention of King Cophetua's <i>riches</i> in the present
ballad, which is the oldest I have met with on the subject.</p>

<p>It is printed from Rich. Johnson's <i>Crown Garland of Goulden</i>
<i>Roses</i>, 1612,<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> 12mo. (where it is intitled simply <i>A Song of a Beggar</i>
<i>and a King</i>:) corrected by another copy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[In the <i>Collection of Old Ballads</i>, 1723 (vol. i. p. 138) there is a
ballad on the same subject as the following popular one. It is entitled
"<i>Cupid's Revenge</i>, or an account of a king who slighted all
women, and at length was constrained to marry a beggar, who
proved a fair and virtuous queen."]</p></div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">Is</span> supposed to have been originally a Scotch ballad. The
reader here has an ancient copy in the English idiom,
with an additional stanza (the 2d.) never before printed.
This curiosity is preserved in the Editor's folio MS. but
not without corruptions, which are here removed by the assistance
of the Scottish Edit. Shakespeare, in his <i>Othello</i>, act ii. has quoted
one stanza, with some variations, which are here adopted: the old
MS. readings of that stanza are however given in the margin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The Scottish version referred to above was printed in Ramsay's
<i>Tea Table Miscellany</i>, and the king mentioned on line 49 is there
named Robert instead of Stephen. He is King Harry in the
folio MS.</p>

<p>The "corruptions" to which Percy alludes are all noted at the
foot of the page, and in one instance at least (line 15) the MS.
gives an important new reading. Mr. Hales thinks that the MS. version
is the oldest form of the ballad, because the definite mention
of the court looks more original than the use of the general term
of town, and he says, "the poem naturally grew vaguer as it grew
generally popular."<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a></p>

<p>Besides the reference to this ballad in <i>Othello</i> mentioned by
Percy above, Mr. Hales has pointed out to me another evident
allusion in the <i>Tempest</i>, act iv. sc. 1, where Trinculo says,</p></div>

<p>The cloak that had been in wear for forty-four years was likely to
be a sorry clout at the end of that time, but the clothes of all
classes were then expected to last from year to year without renewal.
Woollen cloths were of old the chief material of male and female
attire. When new the nap was very long, and after being worn for
some time, it was customary to have it shorn, a process which was
repeated as often as the stuff would bear it. Thus we find the
Countess of Leicester (Eleanor third daughter of King John, and
wife of Simon de Montfort) in 1265, sending Hicque the tailor to
London to get her robes re-shorn.<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a>]</p></div>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span> is from the following stanzas that Shakespeare has
taken his song of the <i>Willow</i>, in his <i>Othello</i>, act iv. sc. 3,
though somewhat varied and applied by him to a female
character. He makes Desdemona introduce it in this
pathetic and affecting manner:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was in love; and he, she lov'd, prov'd mad,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she died singing it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is given from a black-letter copy in the Pepys collection, thus
intitled, <i>A Lover's Complaint, being forsaken of his Love. To a</i>
<i>pleasant tune.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>["Willow, willow" was a favourite burden for songs in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, and one of John Heywood's
songs has the following&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All a grene wyllow; wyllow, wyllow, wyllow,<br /></span>

Collection (i. 54, 55) printed in <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i> (ed. W. Chappell,
1869, Part I. p. 171). Both these are of the first half of the
seventeenth century, and an earlier copy than either is printed by
Mr. Chappell in his <i>Popular Music of the Olden Time</i>, i. 206.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> ballad is quoted in Shakespeare's second Part of

ancient romance of K. Arthur (commonly called <i>Morte</i>
<i>Arthur</i>) being a poetical translation of chap. cviii. cix.
cx. in Pt. 1st, as they stand in ed. 1634, 4to. In the older editions
the chapters are differently numbered.&mdash;This song is given from a
printed copy, corrected in part by a fragment in the Editor's folio
MS.</p>

<p>In the same play of <i>2 Hen. IV.</i> <i>Silence</i> hums a scrap of one of
the old ballads of Robin Hood. It is taken from the following
stanza of <i>Robin Hood and the Pindar of Wakefield</i>.</p>

<span class="i0">"All this beheard three wighty yeomen,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">As he sate under a thorne."<br /></span>

here reprinted.</p>

<p>[This is a rhymed version of some chapters in Malory's <i>Mort</i>
<i>d'Arthur</i> (Book vi. of Caxton's edition), said to have been written
by Thomas Deloney towards the end of Elizabeth's reign. It first
occurs in the <i>Garland of Good Will</i>, reprinted by the Percy Society
(vol. xxx.)</p>

<p>The ballad appears to have been highly popular, and it is quoted
by Marston in the <i>Malcontent</i> and by Beaumont and Fletcher in the
<i>Little French Lawyer</i>, as well as by Shakspere.</p>

<p>The copy in the Percy MS. (ed. Hales and Furnivall, 1867,
vol. i. p. 84) is imperfect in two places, and lines 30 to 60, 73 to 76,
and 95 to 124 are not to be found there, but with these exceptions
it is much the same as the ballad printed here.]</p></div>

little ancient miscellany, intituled, <i>The Golden Garland of Princely</i>

<p>In the same scene of the <i>Twelfth-Night</i>, <i>Sir Toby</i> sings a scrap
of an old ballad, which is preserved in the Pepys Collection (vol. i.
pp. 33, 496), but as it is not only a poor dull performance, but also
very long, it will be sufficient here to give the first stanza:</p>

four voices. This tune appears to have been a very popular one,
and several Scottish songs are to be sung to the "toon of sal I let
her go." The air is also to be found in a Dutch collection of
Songs published at Haarlem in 1626.</p>

GERNUTUS THE JEW OF VENICE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0307.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">In</span> the "<i>Life of Pope Sixtus V.</i> translated from the Italian
of Greg. Leti, by the Rev. Mr. Farneworth, folio," is a
remarkable passage to the following effect:</p>

<p>"It was reported in Rome, that Drake had taken and
plundered St. Domingo in Hispaniola, and carried off an immense
booty. This account came in a private letter to Paul Secchi, a very
considerable merchant in the city, who had large concerns in those
parts, which he had insured. Upon receiving this news, he sent
for the insurer Sampson Ceneda, a Jew, and acquainted him with
it. The Jew, whose interest it was to have such a report thought
false, gave many reasons why it could not possibly be true, and at
last worked himself into such a passion, that he said, I'll lay you a
pound of flesh it is a lye. Secchi, who was of a fiery hot temper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
replied, I'll lay you a thousand crowns against a pound of your
flesh that it is true. The Jew accepted the wager, and articles
were immediately executed betwixt them, That, if Secchi won, he
should himself cut the flesh with a sharp knife from whatever part
of the Jew's body he pleased. The truth of the account was soon
confirmed; and the Jew was almost distracted, when he was
informed, that Secchi had solemnly swore he would compel him
to an exact performance of his contract. A report of this transaction
was brought to the Pope, who sent for the parties, and,
being informed of the whole affair, said, When contracts are made,
it is but just they should be fulfilled, as this shall: Take a knife,
therefore, Secchi, and cut a pound of flesh from any part you please
of the Jew's body. We advise you, however, to be very careful;
for, if you cut but a scruple more or less than your due, you shall
certainly be hanged."</p>

<p>The editor of that book is of opinion that the scene between
Shylock and Antonio in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i> is taken from this
incident. But Mr. Warton, in his ingenious <i>Observations on the</i>
<i>Faerie Queen</i>, vol. i. p. 128, has referred it to the following ballad.
Mr. Warton thinks this ballad was written before Shakespeare's
play, as being not so circumstantial, and having more of the nakedness
of an original. Besides, it differs from the play in many
circumstances, which a meer copyist, such as we may suppose the
ballad-maker to be, would hardly have given himself the trouble to
alter. Indeed he expressly informs us that he had his story from
the Italian writers. See the <i>Connoisseur</i>, vol. i. No. 16.</p>

<p>After all, one would be glad to know what authority <i>Leti</i> had for
the foregoing fact, or at least for connecting it with the taking of
St. Domingo by Drake; for this expedition did not happen till 1585,
and it is very certain that a play of the <i>Jewe</i>, "representing the
greedinesse of worldly chusers, and bloody minds of usurers," had
been exhibited at the playhouse called the <i>Bull</i> before the year
1579, being mentioned in Steph. Gosson's <i>Schoole of Abuse</i>,<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> which
was printed in that year.</p>

<p>As for Shakespeare's <i>Merchant of Venice</i>, the earliest edition
known of it is in quarto 1600; though it had been exhibited in the
year 1598, being mentioned, together with eleven others of his
plays, in Meres's <i>Wits Treasury</i>, &amp;c. 1598, 12mo. fol. 282.</p>

<p>Since the first edition of this book was printed, the editor hath
had reason to believe that both <i>Shakespeare</i> and the author of
this ballad are indebted for their story of the Jew (however they
came by it) to an Italian novel, which was first printed at Milan in
the year 1558, in a book intitled, <i>Il Pecorone, nel quale si contengono</i>
<i>Cinquanta Novelle antiche, &amp;c.</i> republished at Florence about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>the year 1748, or 9.<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> The author was <i>Ser. Giovanni Fiorentino</i>,
who wrote in 1378; thirty years after the time in which the scene
of Boccace's <i>Decameron</i> is laid. (Vid. <i>Manni, Istoria del Decamerone</i>
<i>di Giov. Boccac.</i> 4to. Fior. 1744.)</p>

<p>That Shakespeare had his plot from the novel itself, is evident
from his having some incidents from it, which are not found in the
ballad: and I think it will also be found that he borrowed from
the ballad some hints that were not suggested by the novel. (See
pt. ii. ver. 25, &amp;c. where, instead of that spirited description
of <i>the whetted blade</i>, &amp;c. the prose narrative coldly says, "The
Jew had prepared a razor, &amp;c." See also some other passages in
the same piece.) This however is spoken with diffidence, as I have
at present before me only the abridgement of the novel which
Mr. <i>Johnson</i> has given us at the end of his Commentary on Shakespeare's
Play. The translation of the Italian story at large is not
easy to be met with, having I believe never been published, though
it was printed some years ago with this title,&mdash;"<i>The Novel</i>, from
which the <i>Merchant of Venice</i> written by Shakespeare is taken,
translated from the Italian. To which is added a translation of a
novel from the <i>Decamerone</i> of Boccaccio. London, Printed for
M. Cooper, 1755, 8vo."</p>

<p>The following is printed from an ancient black-letter copy in the
Pepys collection,<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> intitled, "<i>A New Song</i>, shewing the crueltie of
<i>Gernutus</i>, a <i>Jewe</i>, who, lending to a merchant an hundred crowns,
would have a pound of his fleshe, because he could not pay him
at the time appointed. To the tune of Black and Yellow."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[This is the first of four ballads printed by Percy as probable
sources for the plots of four of Shakspere's plays, but as we are
unable to fix any satisfactory date for the first appearance of the
ballads, it is well-nigh impossible to settle their claim to such
distinction.</p>

<p>The story of the Jew who bargained for a pound of a Christian's
flesh in payment of his debt is so widely spread, that there is no
necessity for us to believe that Shakspere used this rather poor
ballad, more especially as it is probable from the extract from
Gosson mentioned above that Shakspere found the two plots of
the bond and the caskets already joined together. There is, however,
something in Percy's note about the whetting of the knife in
verses 25-26, and it would be quite in accordance with the poet's
constant practice for him to take this one point from the ballad of
Gernutus. The ballad was probably versified from one of the
many stories extant, because, even if it be later than Shakspere's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>play, it is impossible to believe that the ballad-writer could have
written so bald a narration had he had the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>
before him.</p>

<p>Some forms of the story are to be found in Persian, and there is
no doubt that the original tale is of Eastern origin. The oldest
European forms are in the English <i>Cursor Mundi</i> and <i>Gesta</i>
<i>Romanorum</i>, and the French romance of <i>Dolopathos</i>. See Miss
Toulmin Smith's paper "On the Bond-story in the <i>Merchant of</i>
<i>Venice</i>," "Transactions of the New Shakspere Society," 1875-6
p. 181. Professor Child prints a ballad entitled <i>The Northern</i>
<i>Lord and Cruel Jew</i> (<i>English and Scottish Ballads</i>, vol. viii. p. 270),
which contains the same incident of the "bloody minded Jew."</p>

<p>Leti's character as an historian stands so low that his story may
safely be dismissed as a fabrication.]</p></div>

modern editors of his smaller poems. A copy of this
madrigal, containing only four stanzas (the 4th and 6th being
wanting), accompanied with the first stanza of the answer, being
printed in "<i>The Passionate Pilgrime</i>, and <i>Sonnets to sundry notes of</i>
<i>Musicke</i>, by Mr. <i>William Shakespeare, Lond.</i> printed for <i>W. Jaggard</i>,
1599." Thus was this sonnet, &amp;c. published as Shakespeare's in
his lifetime.</p>

<p>And yet there is good reason to believe that (not Shakespeare,
but) <i>Christopher Marlow</i> wrote the song, and <i>Sir Walter Raleigh</i>
the <i>Nymph's Reply</i>: For so we are positively assured by Isaac
Walton, a writer of some credit, who has inserted them both in his
<i>Compleat Angler</i>,<a name="FNanchor_879_879" id="FNanchor_879_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879_879" class="fnanchor">[879]</a> under the character of "that smooth song, which
was made by Kit. Marlow, now at least fifty years ago; and ...
an Answer to it, which was made by Sir Walter Raleigh in his
younger days.... Old-fashioned poetry, but choicely good."&mdash;It
also passed for Marlow's in the opinion of his contemporaries;
for in the old poetical miscellany, intitled <i>England's Helicon</i>, it is
printed with the name of <i>Chr. Marlow</i> subjoined to it; and the
<i>Reply</i> is subscribed <i>Ignoto</i>, which is known to have been a signature
of Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i>. With the same signature <i>Ignoto</i>, in that
collection, is an imitation of Marlow's beginning thus:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come live with me, and be my dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we will revel all the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In plains and groves, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Upon the whole I am inclined to attribute them to <i>Marlow</i>, and
<i>Raleigh</i>; notwithstanding the authority of Shakespeare's Book of
Sonnets. For it is well known that as he took no care of his own
compositions, so was he utterly regardless what spurious things
were fathered upon him. Sir <i>John Oldcastle</i>, The <i>London Prodigal</i>,
and The <i>Yorkshire Tragedy</i>, were printed with his name at full
length in the title-pages, while he was living, which yet were afterwards
rejected by his first editors <i>Heminge</i> and <i>Condell</i>, who were
his intimate friends (as he mentions both in his will), and therefore
no doubt had good authority for setting them aside.<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a></p>

<p>The following sonnet appears to have been (as it deserved) a
great favourite with our earlier poets: for, besides the imitation
above-mentioned, another is to be found among <i>Donne's</i> Poems,
intitled <i>The Bait</i>, beginning thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come live with me, and be my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we will some new pleasures prove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of golden sands, &amp;c."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As for <i>Chr. Marlow</i>, who was in high repute for his dramatic
writings, he lost his life by a stab received in a brothel, before the
year 1593. See A. Wood, i. 138.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[These exquisite poems by Christopher Marlowe and Sir Walter
Raleigh at once became popular favourites, and were often reprinted.
The earliest appearance of the first was in Marlowe's
<i>Jew of Malta</i>. An imperfect copy was printed by W. Jaggard with
the <i>Passionate Pilgrim</i> in 1599, and the first stanza of the <i>Reply</i>
was then added to it. In the following year both poems were
correctly printed in <i>England's Helicon</i>, the first being signed "Chr.
Marlow" and the second "Ignoto." When Walton introduced the
poems into his <i>Angler</i> he attributed the <i>Reply</i> to Raleigh, and
printed an additional stanza to each as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Passionate Shepherd</i> (after verse 20).</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy silver dishes for thy meat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As precious as the gods do eat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall on an ivory table be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared each day for thee and me."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Nymph's Reply</i> (after verse 20).</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What should we talk of dainties then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of better meat than's fit for men?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are but vain, that's only good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which God hath blest and sent for food."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the Roxburghe Collection of Ballads (i. 205) is a street ballad
in which these two songs are united and entitled <i>A most excellent ditty</i>
<i>of the Lover's promises to his beloved</i>, with <i>the Lady's prudent answer</i>
<i>to her Love</i>. The verses referred to above as added by Walton are
here printed, but they take the place of verses 17 to 20 of each
song respectively.</p>

<p>Mr. Chappell and Dr. Rimbault have both drawn attention to
the proofs of the popularity of Marlowe's song to be found in out
of the way places. In <i>Choice, Chance, and Change, or Conceits in their</i>
<i>Colours</i> (1606), Tidero being invited to live with his friend, replies,
"Why, how now? do you take me for a woman, that you come
upon me with a ballad of <i>Come live with me and be my love</i>?" In
<i>The World's Folly</i>, 1609, there is the following passage: "But
there sat he, hanging his head, lifting up the eyes, and with a
deep sigh singing the ballad of <i>Come live with me and be my love</i>,
to the tune of <i>Adew my deere</i>." Nicholas Breton refers to it in 1637
as "the old song," but Walton considered it fresh enough to insert
in his <i>Angler</i> in 1653, although Marlowe had then been dead sixty
years.]</p></div>

TITUS ANDRONICUS'S COMPLAINT.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0320.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> reader has here an ancient ballad on the same subject
as the play of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, and it is probable
that the one was borrowed from the other: but which of
them was the original it is not easy to decide. And yet,
if the argument offered above for the priority of the ballad of the
<i>Jew of Venice</i> may be admitted, somewhat of the same kind may be
urged here; for this ballad differs from the play in several particulars,
which a simple ballad-writer would be less likely to alter than an inventive
tragedian. Thus in the ballad is no mention of the contest
for the empire between the two brothers, the composing of which
makes the ungrateful treatment of <i>Titus</i> afterwards the more flagrant:
neither is there any notice taken of his sacrificing one of Tamora's
sons, which the tragic poet has assigned as the original cause of all
her cruelties. In the play Titus loses twenty-one of his sons in
war, and kills another for assisting Bassianus to carry off Lavinia:
the reader will find it different in the ballad. In the latter she is
betrothed to the emperor's son: in the play to his brother. In the
tragedy only two of his sons fall into the pit, and the third being
banished returns to Rome with a victorious army, to avenge the
wrongs of his house: in the ballad all three are entrapped and suffer
death. In the scene the emperor kills Titus, and is in return stabbed
by Titus's surviving son. Here Titus kills the emperor, and afterwards
himself.</p>

<p>Let the reader weigh these circumstances and some others wherein
he will find them unlike, and then pronounce for himself. After all,
there is reason to conclude that this play was rather improved by
Shakespeare with a few fine touches of his pen, than originally
written by him; for, not to mention that the style is less figurative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
than his others generally are, this tragedy is mentioned with discredit
in the Induction to Ben Jonson's <i>Bartholomew Fair</i>, in 1614, as
one that had then been exhibited "five and twenty or thirty
years:" which, if we take the lowest number, throws it back to the
year 1589, at which time Shakespeare was but 25: an earlier date
than can be found for any other of his pieces:<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> and if it does not
clear him entirely of it, shews at least it was a first attempt.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a></p>

<p>The following is given from a copy in <i>The Golden Garland</i>
intitled as above; compared with three others, two of them in
black letter in the Pepys Collection, intitled, <i>The Lamentable and</i>
<i>Tragical History of Titus Andronicus, &amp;c.</i> To the tune of, <i>Fortune</i>.
Printed for E. Wright. Unluckily none of these have any dates.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[No original from which the plot of the play of <i>Titus Andronicus</i>
could be taken has yet been discovered, and it is just possible that
this ballad may have given the hint, but the Registers of the
Stationers' Company go some way towards proving a negative to
this supposition, for on the 6th of February, 1593-4, John Danter
registered <i>A noble Roman Historye of Tytus Andronicus</i>, and also
<i>the ballad thereof</i>.]</p></div>

KING LEIR AND HIS THREE
DAUGHTERS.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0327.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> reader has here an ancient ballad on the subject of
<i>King Lear</i>, which (as a sensible female critic has well
observed<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a>) bears so exact an analogy to the argument of
Shakespeare's play, that his having copied it could not
be doubted, if it were certain that it was written before the tragedy.
Here is found the hint of Lear's madness, which the old chronicles<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a>
do not mention, as also the extravagant cruelty exercised on
him by his daughters. In the death of Lear they likewise very exactly
coincide. The misfortune is, that there is nothing to assist us in
ascertaining the date of the ballad but what little evidence arises
from within; this the reader must weigh and judge for himself.</p>

<p>It may be proper to observe, that Shakespeare was not the first
of our dramatic poets who fitted the story of <i>Leir</i> to the stage. His
first 4to. edition is dated 1608: but three years before that had
been printed a play intitled, <i>The true Chronicle History of Leir and</i>
<i>his three daughters Gonorill, Ragan, and Cordella, as it hath been</i>
<i>divers and sundry times lately acted, 1605, 4to</i>.&mdash;This is a very poor
and dull performance, but happily excited Shakespeare to undertake
the subject, which he has given with very different incidents.
It is remarkable, that neither the circumstances of Leir's madness,
nor his retinue of a select number of knights, nor the affecting deaths
of Cordelia and Leir, are found in that first dramatic piece: in all
which Shakespeare concurs with this ballad.</p>

<p>But to form a true judgement of Shakespeare's merit, the curious
reader should cast his eye over that previous sketch; which he
will find printed at the end of <i>The Twenty Plays of Shakespeare</i>,
republished from the quarto impressions by <i>George Steevens</i>, Esq.;
with such elegance and exactness as led us to expect that fine edition
of all the works of our great dramatic poet, which he hath
since published.</p>

<p>The following ballad is given from an ancient copy in the <i>Golden</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span><i>Garland</i>, bl. let. intitled, <i>A lamentable song of the Death of King</i>
<i>Leir and his Three Daughters</i>. <i>To the tune of When flying Fame.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The old play referred to above, although printed as late as the
year 1605, was probably only a re-impression of a piece entered in
the <i>Stationers' Register</i> in 1594, as it was a frequent practice of the
publishers to take advantage of the popularity of Shakspere's plays
on the stage, by publishing dramas having somewhat the same titles
as his.</p>

<p>The Cordella of the play is softened in the ballad to Cordelia,
the form used by Shakspere and Spenser, but the name Ragan is
retained in place of Shakspere's Regan.]</p></div>

THE FROLICKSOME DUKE, OR THE

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> following ballad is upon the same subject as the
<i>Induction</i> to Shakespeare's <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>: whether
it may be thought to have suggested the hint to
the dramatic poet, or is not rather of later date, the
reader must determine.</p>

<p>The story is told<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> of <i>Philip</i> the <i>Good</i>, Duke of Burgundy; and
is thus related by an old English writer: "The said Duke, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>marriage of Eleonora, sister to the king of Portugall, at Bruges in
Flanders, which was solemnised in the deepe of winter; when as by
reason of unseasonable weather he could neither hawke nor hunt,
and was now tired with cards, dice, &amp;c. and such other domestick
sports, or to see ladies dance; with some of his courtiers, he would
in the evening walke disguised all about the towne. It so fortuned,
as he was walking late one night, he found a countrey fellow dead
drunke, snorting on a bulke; he caused his followers to bring him
to his palace, and there stripping him of his old clothes, and
attyring him after the court fashion, when he wakened, he and
they were all ready to attend upon his excellency, and persuade
him that he was some great Duke. The poor fellow admiring how
he came there, was served in state all day long: after supper he
saw them dance, heard musicke, and all the rest of those court-like
pleasures: but late at night, when he was well tipled, and
again fast asleepe, they put on his old robes, and so conveyed him
to the place, where they first found him. Now the fellow had not
made them so good sport the day before, as he did now, when he
returned to himself: all the jest was to see how he looked upon it.
In conclusion, after some little admiration, the poore man told his
friends he had seen a vision; constantly believed it; would not
otherwise be persuaded, and so the jest ended." Burton's <i>Anatomy</i>
<i>of Melancholy</i>, pt. ii. sect. 2. Memb. 4, 2nd ed. 1624, fol.</p>

<p>This ballad is given from a black-letter copy in the Pepys Collection,
which is intitled as above. "To the tune of <i>Fond Boy</i>."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The story of this ballad is of Eastern origin, and is the same as
the tale of <i>the Sleeper awakened</i> in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>. The story
crops up in many places, some of which are pointed out in Prof.
Child's <i>English and Scottish Ballads</i> (vol. viii. p. 54). The question,
however, of its origin is not of immediate interest in the discussion
of Shakspere's plots, because the author of the old play, <i>Taming</i>
<i>of a Shrew</i>, had already used the subject and named the tinker
Slie, so that we have not far to seek for Shakspere's original.]</p></div>

to our late excellent Poet <i>Dr. Goldsmith</i>, the plan of his beautiful
ballad of <i>Edwin and Emma</i> (first printed in his <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>)
it is but justice to his memory to declare, that his poem was
written first, and that if there is any imitation in the case, they will be
found both to be indebted to the beautiful old ballad <i>Gentle Herdsman</i>,
&amp;c. printed in the second volume of this Work, which the
Doctor had much admired in manuscript, and has finely improved.

<h3>I.<br />
<br />
THE MORE MODERN BALLAD OF
CHEVY CHACE.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0345a.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">At</span> the beginning of this volume we gave the old original
Song of <i>Chevy Chace</i>. The reader has here the more
improved edition of that fine heroic ballad. It will
afford an agreeable entertainment to the curious to
compare them together, and to see how far the latter bard has excelled
his predecessor, and where he has fallen short of him. For
tho' he has every where improved the versification, and generally
the sentiment and diction; yet some few passages retain more
dignity in the ancient copy; at least the obsoleteness of the style
serves as a veil to hide whatever might appear too familiar or vulgar
in them. Thus, for instance, the catastrophe of the gallant
Witherington is in the modern copy exprest in terms which never
fail at present to excite ridicule: whereas in the original it is related
with a plain and pathetic simplicity, that is liable to no such
unlucky effect: See the stanza in page <a href="#Page_32">32</a>, which, in modern orthography,
&amp;c. would run thus.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For Witherington my heart is woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That ever he slain should be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when his legs were hewn in two,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He knelt and fought on his knee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So again the stanza which describes the fall of Montgomery is
somewhat more elevated in the ancient copy:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The dint it was both sad and sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He on Montgomery set:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swan-feathers his arrow bore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With his hearts blood were wet."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right">p. <a href="#Page_31">31</a>.</p>

<p>We might also add, that the circumstances of the battle are
more clearly conceived and the several incidents more distinctly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
marked in the old original, than in the improved copy. It is well
known that the ancient English weapon was the long bow, and
that this nation excelled all others in archery; while the Scottish
warriours chiefly depended on the use of the spear: this characteristic
difference never escapes our ancient bard, whose description
of the first onset is to the following effect:</p>

<p>"The proposal of the two gallant earls to determine the dispute
by single combat being over-ruled; the English, says he, who
stood with their bows ready bent, gave a general discharge of their
arrows, which slew seven score spearmen of the enemy: but, notwithstanding
so severe a loss, Douglas like a brave captain kept
his ground. He had divided his forces into three columns, who,
as soon as the English had discharged the first volley, bore down upon
them with their spears, and breaking through their ranks reduced
them to close fighting. The archers upon this dropt their bows
and had recourse to their swords, and there followed so sharp a
conflict, that multitudes on both sides lost their lives." In the midst
of this general engagement, at length, the two great earls meet,
and after a spirited rencounter agree to breathe; upon which a
parley ensues, that would do honour to Homer himself.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more pleasingly distinct and circumstantial than
this: whereas, the modern copy, tho' in general it has great merit,
is here unluckily both confused and obscure. Indeed the original
words seem here to have been totally misunderstood. "Yet bydys
the yerl Douglas upon the <i>Bent</i>," evidently signifies, "Yet the earl
Douglas abides in the <i>Field</i>:" whereas the more modern bard
seems to have understood by <i>Bent</i>, the inclination of his mind,
and accordingly runs quite off from the subject<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To drive the deer with hound and horn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Earl Douglas had the bent."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right">v. 109.</p>

<p>One may also observe a generous impartiality in the old original
bard, when in the conclusion of his tale he represents both
nations as quitting the field without any reproachful reflection on
either: though he gives to his own countrymen the credit of being
the smaller number.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of fifteen hundred archers of England<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Went away but fifty and three;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of twenty hundred spearmen of Scotland,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But even five and fifty."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right">p. <a href="#Page_32">32</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p>He attributes <i>Flight</i> to neither party, as hath been done in the
modern copies of this ballad, as well Scotch as English. For, to
be even with our latter bard, who makes the Scots to <i>flee</i>, some
reviser of North Britain has turned his own arms against him, and
printed an edition at Glasgow, in which the lines are thus transposed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of fifteen hundred Scottish speirs<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Went hame but fifty-three:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of twenty hundred Englishmen<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Scarce fifty-five did flee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And to countenance this change he has suppressed the two stanzas
between ver. 240 and ver. 249.&mdash;From that Edition I have here
reformed the Scottish names, which in the modern English ballad
appeared to be corrupted.</p>

<p>When I call the present admired ballad modern, I only mean
that it is comparatively so; for that it could not be writ much
later than the time of Q. Elizabeth, I think may be made appear;
nor yet does it seem to be older than the beginning of the last
century.<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> Sir Philip Sidney, when he complains of the antiquated
phrase of <i>Chevy Chase</i>, could never have seen this improved copy,
the language of which is not more ancient than that he himself
used. It is probable that the encomiums of so admired a writer
excited some bard to revise the ballad, and to free it from those
faults he had objected to it. That it could not be much later than
that time, appears from the phrase <i>doleful dumps</i>: which in that
age carried no ill sound with it, but to the next generation became
ridiculous. We have seen it pass uncensured in a sonnet that was
at that time in request, and where it could not fail to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>taken notice of, had it been in the least exceptionable: see above,
book ii. song v. ver. 2. Yet, in about half a century after, it was
become burlesque. Vide <i>Hudibras</i>, Part I. c. 3, v. 95.</p>

<p>This much premised, the reader that would see the general
beauties of this ballad set in a just and striking light, may consult
the excellent criticism of Mr. Addison.<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> With regard to its subject:
it has already been considered in page <a href="#Page_20">20</a>. The conjectures there
offered will receive confirmation from a passage in the <i>Memoirs of</i>
<i>Carey Earl of Monmouth</i>, 8vo. 1759, p. 165; whence we learn
that it was an ancient custom with the borderers of the two kingdoms,
when they were at peace, to send to the Lord Wardens of
the opposite Marches for leave to hunt within their districts. If
leave was granted, then towards the end of summer they would
come and hunt for several days together "with their <i>greyhounds</i>
<i>for deer</i>:" but if they took this liberty unpermitted, then the Lord
Warden of the border so invaded, would not fail to interrupt their
sport and chastise their boldness. He mentions a remarkable instance
that happened while he was Warden, when some Scotch
gentlemen coming to hunt in defiance of him, there must have
ensued such an action as this of Chevy Chace, if the intruders had
been proportionably numerous and well-armed; for, upon their
being attacked by his men at arms, he tells us, "some hurt was
done, tho' he had given especiall order that they should shed as
little blood as possible." They were in effect overpowered and taken
prisoners, and only released on their promise to abstain from such
licentious sporting for the future.</p>

<p>Since the former impression of these volumes hath been published,
a new edition of <i>Collins's Peerage</i>, 1779, &amp;c., 9 Vols. 8vo.
which contains, in volume ii. p. 334, an historical passage, which
may be thought to throw considerable light on the subject of the
preceding ballad: viz.</p>

<p>"In this ... year, 1436, according to Hector Boethius, was
fought the Battle of Pepperden, not far from the Cheviot Hills,
between the Earl of Northumberland (IId Earl, son of Hotspur,)
and Earl William Douglas, of Angus, with a small army of about
four thousand men each, in which the latter had the advantage.
As this seems to have been a private conflict between these two
great chieftains of the Borders, rather than a national war, it has
been thought to have given rise to the celebrated old Ballad of
<i>Chevy-Chase</i>; which, to render it more pathetic and interesting,
has been heightened with tragical incidents wholly fictitious." See
<i>Ridpath's Border Hist.</i> 4to, p. 401.</p>

<p>The following text is given from a copy in the Editor's folio MS.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>compared with two or three others printed in black-letter.&mdash;In the
second volume of <i>Dryden's Miscellanies</i> may be found a translation
of Chevy-Chace into Latin rhymes. The translator, Mr. Henry
Bold, of New College, undertook it at the command of Dr. Compton,
bishop of London; who thought it no derogation to his episcopal
character, to avow a fondness for this excellent old ballad.
See the preface to <i>Bold's Latin Songs</i>, 1685, 8vo.</p>

<p>The surnames in the foregoing Ballad are altered, either by
accident or design, from the old original copy, and in common
editions extremely corrupted. They are here rectified, as much as
they could be. Thus,</p>

<p>[Ver. 202, <i>Egerton</i>.] This name is restored (instead of <i>Ogerton</i>,
com. ed.) from the Editor's folio MS. The pieces in that MS.
appear to have been collected, and many of them composed
(among which might be this ballad) by an inhabitant of Cheshire;
who was willing to pay a compliment here to one of his countrymen,
of the eminent family <i>De</i> or <i>Of Egerton</i> (so the name was
first written) ancestors of the present Duke of Bridgwater: and this
he could do with the more propriety, as the <i>Percies</i> had formerly
great interest in that county. At the fatal battle of Shrewsbury
all the flower of the Cheshire gentlemen lost their lives fighting in
the cause of <i>Hotspur</i>.</p>

<p>[Ver. 203, <i>Ratcliff</i>.] This was a family much distinguished in
Northumberland. <i>Edw. Radcliffe, mil.</i> was sheriff of that county
in the 17 of Hen. VII. and others of the same surname afterwards.
(See <i>Fuller</i>, p. 313.) Sir <i>George Ratcliff</i>, Knt. was one of the
commissioners of inclosure in 1552. (See <i>Nicholson</i>, p. 330.) Of
this family was the late Earl of <i>Derwentwater</i>, who was beheaded
in 1715. The Editor's folio MS. however, reads here, <i>Sir Robert</i>
<i>Harcliffe and Sir William</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Harcleys</i> were an eminent family in Cumberland. (See <i>Fuller</i>,
p. 224.) Whether this may be thought to be the same name, I do
not determine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>
<p>[Ver. 204. <i>Baron.</i>] This is apparently altered, (not to say corrupted)
from <i>Hearone</i>, in p. 32, ver. 114.</p>

<p>[Ver. 207. <i>Raby.</i>] This might be intended to celebrate one of
the ancient possessors of <i>Raby Castle</i>, in the county of Durham.
Yet it is written <i>Rebbye</i>, in the fol. MS. and looks like a corruption
of <i>Rugby</i> or <i>Rokeby</i>, an eminent family in Yorkshire, see pp. <a href="#Page_32">32</a>, <a href="#Page_52">52</a>.
It will not be wondered that the <i>Percies</i> should be thought to bring
followers out of that county, where they themselves were originally
seated, and had always such extensive property and influence.<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a></p>

<p>[Ver. 215. <i>Murray.</i>] So the Scottish copy. In the com. edit.
it is <i>Carrel</i> or <i>Currel</i>; and <i>Morrell</i> in the fol. MS.</p>

<p>[Ver. 217. <i>Murray.</i>] So the Scot. edit.&mdash;The common copies
read <i>Murrel</i>. The fol. MS. gives the line in the following peculiar
manner,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sir Roger Heuer of Harcliffe too."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>[Ver. 219. <i>Lamb.</i>] The folio MS. has</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sir David Lambwell, well esteemed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This seems evidently corrupted from <i>Lwdale</i> or <i>Liddell</i>, in the old
copy, see ver. 125. (pp. 32, 52).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_894_894" id="Footnote_894_894"></a><a href="#FNanchor_894_894"><span class="label">[894]</span></a> A late writer has started a notion that the more modern copy
"was written to be sung by a party of English, headed by a Douglas
in the year 1524; which is the true reason why, at the same
time that it gives the advantage to the English soldiers above the
Scotch, it gives yet so lovely and so manifestly superior a character
to the Scotch commander above the English." See <i>Say's Essay on</i>
<i>the Numbers of Paradise Lost</i>, 4to. 1745, p. 167.
</p>
<p>
This appears to me a groundless conjecture: the language seems
too modern for the date above-mentioned; and, had it been printed
even so early as Queen Elizabeth's reign, I think I should have
met with some copy wherein the first line would have been,

of deer, and almost stript of their woods: but formerly they had
enough of both to justify the description attempted here and in
the Ancient Ballad of <i>Chevy-Chase</i>. Leland, in the reign of Hen.
VIII. thus describes this county: "In Northumberland, as I heare
say, be no Forests, except Chivet Hills; where is much <i>Brushe-Wood</i>,

THE RISING IN THE NORTH.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0362.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of this ballad is the great Northern Insurrection
in the 12th year of Elizabeth, 1569; which
proved so fatal to Thomas Percy, the seventh Earl of
Northumberland.</p>

<p>There had not long before been a secret negotiation entered into
between some of the Scottish and English nobility, to bring about
a marriage between Mary Q. of Scots, at that time a prisoner in
England, and the Duke of Norfolk, a nobleman of excellent character,
and firmly attached to the Protestant religion. This match
was proposed to all the most considerable of the English nobility,
and among the rest to the Earls of Northumberland and Westmoreland,
two noblemen very powerful in the North. As it seemed
to promise a speedy and safe conclusion of the troubles in Scotland,
with many advantages to the crown of England, they all consented
to it, provided it should prove agreeable to Q. Elizabeth. The
Earl of Leicester (Elizabeth's favourite) undertook to break the
matter to her, but before he could find an opportunity, the affair
had come to her ears by other hands, and she was thrown into a
violent flame. The Duke of Norfolk, with several of his friends,
was committed to the Tower, and summons were sent to the
Northern Earls instantly to make their appearance at court. It is
said that the Earl of Northumberland, who was a man of a mild
and gentle nature, was deliberating with himself whether he should
not obey the message, and rely upon the queen's candour and
clemency, when he was forced into desperate measures by a
sudden report at midnight, Nov. 14, that a party of his enemies
were come to seize on his person.<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> The Earl was then at his
house at Topcliffe in Yorkshire. When rising hastily out of bed,
he withdrew to the Earl of Westmoreland, at Brancepeth, where
the country came in to them, and pressed them to take arms in
their own defence. They accordingly set up their standards, declaring
their intent was to restore the ancient religion, to get the
succession of the crown firmly settled, and to prevent the destruction
of the ancient nobility, &amp;c. Their common banner<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> (on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>which was displayed the cross, together with the five wounds of
Christ) was borne by an ancient gentleman, Richard Norton, Esq.,
of Norton-conyers; who, with his sons (among whom, Christopher,
Marmaduke, and Thomas, are expressly named by Camden), distinguished
himself on this occasion. Having entered Durham,
they tore the Bible, &amp;c., and caused mass to be said there: they
then marched on to Clifford-moor near Wetherbye, where they mustered
their men. Their intention was to have proceeded on to York,
but, altering their minds, they fell upon Barnard's castle, which
Sir George Bowes held out against them for eleven days. The
two earls, who spent their large estates in hospitality, and were extremely
beloved on that account, were masters of little ready
money; the E. of Northumberland bringing with him only 8000
crowns, and the E. of Westmoreland nothing at all for the subsistence
of their forces, they were not able to march to London, as
they had at first intended. In these circumstances, Westmoreland
began so visibly to despond, that many of his men slunk away,
tho' Northumberland still kept up his resolution, and was master
of the field till December 13, when the Earl of Sussex, accompanied
with Lord Hunsden and others, having marched out of York at
the head of a large body of forces, and being followed by a still
larger army under the command of Ambrose Dudley, Earl of Warwick,
the insurgents retreated northward towards the borders, and
there dismissing their followers, made their escape into Scotland.
Tho' this insurrection had been suppressed with so little bloodshed,
the Earl of Sussex and Sir George Bowes, marshal of the army, put
vast numbers to death by martial law, without any regular trial.
The former of these caused sixty-three constables to be hanged at
once. And the latter made his boast, that, for sixty miles in length,
and forty in breadth, betwixt Newcastle and Wetherby, there was
hardly a town or village wherein he had not executed some of
the inhabitants. This exceeds the cruelties practised in the West
after Monmouth's rebellion: but that was not the age of tenderness
and humanity.</p>

<p>Such is the account collected from Stow, Speed, Camden, Guthrie,
Carte, and Rapin; it agrees in most particulars with the
following ballad, which was apparently the production of some
northern minstrel, who was well affected to the two noblemen. It is
here printed from two MS. copies, one of them in the Editor's folio
collection. They contained considerable variations, out of which
such readings were chosen as seemed most poetical and consonant
to history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The Northern Rebellion of 1569 has been nobly commemorated
in verse. Besides the two following ballads there is the one entitled
the <i>Earle of Westmorlande</i>, in the folio MS. which was printed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the first time in 1867, and also Wordsworth's matchless poem of
the <i>White Doe of Rylstone</i>. Those readers who wish for further
particulars respecting this ill-starred insurrection, should see Mr.
Hales's interesting introduction to the <i>Earl of Westmoreland</i> (Folio
MS., ed. Hales and Furnivall, vol. i. p. 292).</p>

<p>Percy acknowledges above that he has not followed the folio MS.
very closely, and his variations will be seen by comparing his version
with the copy now printed at the end.]</p></div>

Earls of Westmoreland, were Two Bulls Argent, ducally collar'd
Gold, armed Or, &amp;c. But I have not discovered the device mentioned
in the ballad, among the badges, &amp;c. given by that house.
This, however, is certain, that among those of the <i>Nevilles</i>, Lords
Abergavenny (who were of the same family) is a <i>Dun Cow</i> with a
golden Collar: and the <i>Nevilles</i> of Chyte in Yorkshire (of the
Westmoreland branch) gave for their crest, in 1513, a <i>Dog's</i> (Greyhound's) Head erased. So that it is not improbable but <i>Charles</i>
<i>Neville</i>, the unhappy Earl of Westmoreland here mentioned, might
on this occasion give the above device on his banner. After all
our old minstrel's verses here may have undergone some corruption;
for, in another Ballad in the same folio MS. and apparently
written by the same hand, containing the sequel of this
Lord Westmoreland's history, his banner is thus described, more
conformable to his known bearings:

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> ballad may be considered as the sequel of the preceding.
After the unfortunate Earl of Northumberland
had seen himself forsaken of his followers, he endeavoured
to withdraw into Scotland, but falling into
the hands of the thievish borderers, was stript and otherwise ill-treated
by them. At length he reached the house of Hector, of
Harlaw, an Armstrong, with whom he hoped to lie concealed: for,
Hector had engaged his honour to be true to him, and was under
great obligations to this unhappy nobleman. But this faithless
wretch betrayed his guest for a sum of money to Murray the Regent
of Scotland, who sent him to the castle of Lough-leven, then
belonging to William Douglas. All the writers of that time assure
us that Hector, who was rich before, fell shortly after into poverty,
and became so infamous, that <i>to take Hector's cloak</i>, grew into a
proverb to express a man who betrays his friend. See Camden,
Carleton, Holinshed, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Lord Northumberland continued in the castle of Lough-leven
till the year 1572; when James Douglas, Earl of Morton, being
elected Regent, he was given up to the Lord Hunsden at Berwick,
and being carried to York suffered death. As Morton's party depended
on Elizabeth for protection, an elegant historian thinks
"it was scarce possible for them to refuse putting into her hands
a person who had taken up arms against her. But, as a sum of
money was paid on that account, and shared between Morton and
his kinsman Douglas, the former of whom, during his exile in
England, had been much indebted to Northumberland's friendship,
the abandoning this unhappy nobleman to inevitable destruction
was deemed an ungrateful and mercenary act." Robertson's Hist.</p>

<p>So far history coincides with this ballad, which was apparently
written by some Northern bard soon after the event. The interposal
of the <i>witch-lady</i> (v. 53) is probably his own invention: yet,
even this hath some countenance from history; for about 25 years
before, the Lady Jane Douglas, Lady Glamis, sister of the earl of
Angus, and nearly related to Douglas of Lough-leven, had suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
death for the pretended crime of witchcraft; who, it is presumed,
is the Witch-lady alluded to in verse 133.</p>

<p>The following is selected (like the former) from two copies,
which contained great variations; one of them in the Editor's folio
MS. In the other copy some of the stanzas at the beginning of
this Ballad are nearly the same with what in that MS. are made to
begin another Ballad on the escape of the E. of Westmoreland,
who got safe into Flanders, and is feigned in the ballad to have
undergone a great variety of adventures.</p>

<p>[Percy wrote the following note on the version of this ballad in
his folio MS. "To correct this by my other copy which seems
more modern. The other copy in many parts preferable to this."
It will be seen by comparing the text with the folio MS. copy, now
printed at the end, that the alterations are numerous. The first
three stanzas are taken with certain changes from the ballad of
"The Erle of Westmoreland" (Folio MS. vol. i. p. 300). The
alterations made in them are not improvements, as, for instance,
the old reading of verse 2 is&mdash;</p></div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> excellent philosophical song appears to have been
famous in the sixteenth century. It is quoted by Ben
Jonson in his play of <i>Every Man out of his Humour</i>,
first acted in 1599, act i. sc. 1, where an impatient
person says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I am no such pil'd cynique to believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beggery is the onely happinesse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, with a number of these patient fooles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sing, 'My minde to me a kingdome is,'<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>
<p>It is here chiefly printed from a thin quarto Music book, intitled,
"Psalmes, Sonets, and Songs of sadnes and pietie, made into
Musicke of five parts: &amp;c. By William Byrd, one of the Gent. of
the Queenes Majesties honorable Chappell.&mdash;Printed by Thomas
East, &amp;c." 4to. no date: but Ames in his <i>Typog.</i> has mentioned
another edit. of the same book, dated 1588, which I take to have
been later than this.</p>

<p>Some improvements and an additional stanza (sc. the 5th), were
had from two other ancient copies; one of them in black letter in
the Pepys Collection, thus inscribed, "A sweet and pleasant sonet,
intitled, 'My Minde to me a Kingdom is.' To the tune of, In
Crete, &amp;c."</p>

<p>Some of the stanzas in this poem were printed by Byrd separate
from the rest: they are here given in what seemed the most natural
order.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The longest and apparently earliest version of this favourite
poem is signed "E. Dier," in MS. Rawl. Poet. 85, fol. 17 in the
Bodleian Library, and Dr. Hannah<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> attributes it to Sir Edward
Dyer, the friend of Spenser and Sidney, whose little pieces were
chiefly printed in <i>England's Helicon</i>. Sir Edward Dyer, of Sharpham
Park, Somersetshire, was born about the year 1540. He was
educated at Oxford, and afterwards was employed in several embassies.
On the death of Sir John Wolley he was made Chancellor
of the Order of the Garter, and at the same time knighted. He
was an alchemist and dupe of Dr. Dee and Edward Kelly. Sir
Egerton Brydges quotes from Aubrey the statement that he had
four thousand pounds a year, and had four-score thousand pounds
left to him, which he wasted almost all, but Sir Egerton considers
the sums almost incredible for the time.</p>

<p>In "Posthumi or Sylvesters Remains, revived out of the ashes of
that silver-tongued translatour and divine Poet Laureat," at the
end of the translation of the <i>Divine Weekes</i> of Du Bartas, 1641,
there is the following parody of this favourite poem:</p></div>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> subject of this tale is taken from that entertaining
Colloquy of <i>Erasmus</i>, intitled, "Uxor &Mu;&epsilon;&mu;&psi;&#x1F77;&gamma;&alpha;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;, sive
Conjugium:" which has been agreeably modernized
by the late Mr. <i>Spence</i>, in his little Miscellaneous Publication,
intitled, "<i>Moralities</i>, &amp;c. by Sir Harry Beaumont," 1753,
8vo. pag. 42.</p>

<p>The following stanzas are extracted from an ancient poem intitled
<i>Albion's England</i>, written by <i>W. Warner</i>, a celebrated poet
in the reign of Q. Elizabeth, though his name and works are now
equally forgotten. The reader will find some account of him in
vol. ii. book ii. song 24.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>The following stanzas are printed from the author's improved
edition of his work, printed in 1602, 4to.; the third impression of
which appeared so early as 1592, in bl. let. 4to. The edition in
1602 is in thirteen books; and so it is reprinted in 1612, 4to.;
yet, in 1606, was published "A Continuance of Albion's England,
by the first author, W. W. Lond. 4to.:" this contains Books xiv.
xv. xvi. There is also extant, under the name of Warner, "Syrinx,
or a seven-fold Historie, pleasant, and profitable, comical, and
tragical," 4to.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The title of this poem challenges comparison with <i>Patient</i>
<i>Griselda</i>, but it is in fact a totally different story, and as Mr. Hales
says, "represents rather tact and management than patience in the
wife of an unfaithful (not a tempting and essaying) husband." The
first edition of Warner's poem was published in 1586, and the
numerous impressions of it prove its popularity. The full title is
as follows: "Albion's England, a continued History of the same
Kingdome from the Originals of the first inhabitants thereof, unto
the raigne of Queen Elizabeth."]</p></div>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> following stanzas were written by <i>Michael Drayton</i>,
a poet of some eminence in the reigns of Q. Elizabeth,
James I. and Charles I.<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> They are inserted in one of
his Pastorals, the first edition of which bears this
whimsical title, "Idea. The Shepheards Garland fashioned in
nine Eglogs. Rowlands sacrifice to the nine muses. Lond. 1593."
4to. They are inscribed with the author's name at length "To
the noble and valerous gentleman master Robert Dudley, &amp;c." It
is very remarkable that when Drayton reprinted them in the first
folio edit. of his works, 1619, he had given those Eclogues so
thorough a revisal, that there is hardly a line to be found the
same as in the old edition. This poem had received the fewest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>corrections, and therefore is chiefly given from the ancient copy,
where it is thus introduced by one of his Shepherds:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Listen to mee, my lovely shepheards joye.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And thou shall heare, with mirth and mickle glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pretie tale, which when I was a boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My toothles grandame oft hath tolde to me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The author has professedly imitated the style and metre of
some of the old metrical romances, particularly that of <i>Sir</i>
<i>Isenbras</i><a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> (alluded to in v. 3), as the reader may judge from the
following specimen:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lordynges, lysten, and you shal here, &amp;c.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall well heare of a knight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was in warre full wyght,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And doughtye of his dede:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name was Syr Isenbras,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man nobler then he was<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lyved none with breade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was lyvely, large, and longe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shoulders broade, and armes stronge,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He was a hardye man, and hye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All men hym loved that hym se,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For a gentyll knight was he:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harpers loved him in hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With other minstrells all,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For he gave them golde and fee," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This ancient legend was printed in black-letter, 4to. by Wyllyam
Copland; no date.<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> In the Cotton Library (Calig. A 2) is a MS.
copy of the same romance containing the greatest variations.
They are probably two different translations of some French
original.</p>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Affords</span> a pretty poetical contest between Pleasure
and Honour. It is found at the end of <i>Hymen's</i>
<i>Triumph: a pastoral tragicomedie</i>, written by Daniel,
and printed among his works, 4to. 1623.<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a> <i>Daniel</i>, who
was a contemporary of Drayton's, and is said to have been poet
laureat to Queen Elizabeth, was born in 1562, and died in 1619.
<i>Anne</i>, Countess of Dorset, Pembroke, and Montgomery (to whom
Daniel had been tutor), has inserted a small portrait of him in a
full-length picture of herself, preserved at Appleby Castle, in
Cumberland.</p>

<p>This little poem is the rather selected for a specimen of Daniel's
poetic powers, as it is omitted in the later edition of his works,
2 vols. 12mo. 1718.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Samuel Daniel was born in Somersetshire, and educated at
Magdalen Hall, Oxford. He left college without a degree, "his
geny being," according to Ant. &agrave; Wood, "more prone to easier
and smoother subjects than in pecking and hewing at logic." He
was tutor to Lady Anne Clifford, subsequently Countess of Pembroke,
and afterwards groom of the privy chamber to Anne, queen
of James I. Browne calls him in <i>Britannia's Pastorals</i>, "Wel-languaged
Daniel," and the union of power of thought with sweetness
and grace of expression exhibited by him is highly praised by
Southey and Coleridge. He was free from indelicacy in his writings,
and Fuller says of him that "he carried in his Christian and
surname two holy prophets, his monitors, so to qualify his raptures
that he abhorred all profaneness."]</p></div>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">This</span> beautiful poem, which possesses a classical elegance
hardly to be expected in the age of James I. is printed
from the 4th edition of Davison's Poems,<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> &amp;c. 1621.
It is also found in a later miscellany, intitled, "Le
Prince d'Amour," 1660, 8vo. Francis Davison, editor of the poems
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>above referred to, was son of that unfortunate secretary of state
who suffered so much from the affair of Mary Q. of Scots. These
poems, he tells us in his preface, were written by himself, by his
brother [Walter], who was a soldier in the wars of the Low Countries,
and by some dear friends "anonymoi." Among them are
found some pieces by Sir J. Davis, the Countess of Pembroke, Sir
Philip Sidney, Spenser, and other wits of those times.</p>

<p>In the fourth vol. of <i>Dryden's Miscellanies</i>, this poem is attributed
to Sydney Godolphin, Esq.; but erroneously, being probably
written before he was born. One edit. of Davison's book
was published in 1608. Godolphin was born in 1610, and died
in 1642-3. Ath. Ox. ii. 23.</p>

GILDEROY</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/dec-0414.png" height="100" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Was</span> a famous robber, who lived about the middle of the
last century, if we may credit the histories and storybooks
of highwaymen, which relate many improbable
feats of him, as his robbing Cardinal Richelieu, Oliver
Cromwell, &amp;c. But these stories have probably no other authority
than the records of Grub-street. At least the <i>Gilderoy</i>, who is the
hero of Scottish songsters, seems to have lived in an earlier age;
for, in Thompson's <i>Orpheus Caledonius</i>, vol. ii. 1733, 8vo. is a
copy of this ballad, which, tho' corrupt and interpolated, contains
some lines that appear to be of genuine antiquity: in these he is
represented as contemporary with Mary Q. of Scots: <i>ex. gr.</i></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Queen of Scots possessed nought,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That my love let me want:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For cow and ew he to me brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And een whan they were scant.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these did honestly possess<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He never did annoy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who never fail'd to pay their cess<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To my love Gilderoy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These lines perhaps might safely have been inserted among the
following stanzas, which are given from a written copy, that appears
to have received some modern corrections. Indeed, the common
popular ballad contained some indecent luxuriances that required
the pruning-hook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[The subject of this ballad was a ruffian totally unworthy of the
poetic honours given to him, and the poem itself can in no
way be looked upon as historic. To mention but one instance
of its departure from truth&mdash;the song is said to have been written
by a young woman of a superior station in society who had been
induced to live with the freebooter, but the fact was that one
thousand marks having been offered for his apprehension, he was
betrayed by his mistress Peg Cunningham, and captured after killing
eight of the men sent against him, and stabbing the woman.</p>

<p>He was one of the proscribed clan Gregor, and a notorious lifter
of cattle in the Highlands of Perthshire for some time before
1636. In February of that year seven of his accomplices were
taken, tried, condemned, and executed at Edinburgh. These
men were apprehended chiefly through the exertions of the Stewarts
of Athol, and in revenge Gilderoy burned several of the houses
belonging to the Stewarts. In a few months, however, he was
captured, as before mentioned, and in July, 1636, was hanged
with five accomplices at the Gallowlee, between Leith and Edinburgh.
As a mark of unenviable distinction, Gilderoy was hanged
on a gallows higher than the rest. It is curious that this wretched
miscreant, who robbed the poor and outraged all women who
came in his way, should have become popular in the south of
Britain. His adventures, with the various details noticed above
by Percy, are related in Captain Alexander Smith's <i>History of</i>
<i>Highwaymen</i>, &amp;c., 1719, and in Johnson's <i>Lives and Exploits of</i>
<i>Highwaymen</i>, 1734.</p>

<p>The earliest known version of this song was printed in London
in 1650, and another is included in <i>Westminster Drollery</i>, 1671.
The latter consists of five stanzas, the first being:</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Was ever grief so great as mine<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then speak dear bearn, I prethee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thus must leave my Gilderoy,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O my benison gang with thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good speed be with you then Sir she said<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For gone is all my joy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gone is he whom I love best,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My handsome Gilderoy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The second stanza is Percy's fifth, with some of the "luxuriances"
he refers to. The third stanza is a variation of Percy's first.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now Gilderoy was bonny boy<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would needs to th' King be gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his silken garters on his legs,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the roses on his shoone.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But better he had staid at home<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With me his only joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For on a gallow tree they hung<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My handsome Gilderoy."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The fourth stanza is a variety of Percy's eleventh, and the fifth
of his ninth.</p>

<p>There is another version of this song in the <i>Collection of Old</i>
<i>Ballads</i>, 1723 (vol. i.), entitled "The Scotch Lover's Lamentation,
or Gilderoy's last farewell," which contains some few "luxuriances,"
but is on the whole superior to the "improved" one here printed.
This was altered by Lady Wardlaw, who added the stanzas between
brackets, besides the one quoted above by Percy.</p>

<p>Gilderoy is now, perhaps, better known by Campbell's song
than by this ballad. The name is a corruption of the Gaelic <i>gille</i>
<i>roy</i>, red-haired boy.]</p></div>

</div>
<p class="drop-capm"><span class="smcap">Was</span> published in a small collection of poems, intitled
<i>Euthemia, or the Power of Harmony</i>, &amp;c. 1756, written
in 1748, by the ingenious Dr. <i>Harrington</i>, of Bath, who
never allowed them to be published, and withheld his
name till it could no longer be concealed. The following copy
was furnished by the late Mr. <i>Shenstone</i>, with some variations and
corrections of his own, which he had taken the liberty to propose,
and for which the author's indulgence was intreated. In this
edition it was intended to reprint the author's own original copy;
but, as that may be seen correctly given in <i>Pearch's</i> Collection,
vol. i. 1783, p. 161, it was thought the reader of taste would
wish to have the variations preserved, they are, therefore, still
retained here, which it is hoped the worthy author will excuse with
his wonted liberality.</p>

<p><i>Wokey-hole</i> is a noted cavern in Somersetshire, which has given
birth to as many wild fanciful stories as the Sybils Cave, in Italy.
Thro' a very narrow entrance, it opens into a very large vault, the
roof whereof, either on account of its height, or the thickness of
the gloom, cannot be discovered by the light of torches. It goes
winding a great way underground, is crossed by a stream of very
cold water, and is all horrid with broken pieces of rock: many of
these are evident petrifactions; which, on account of their singular
forms, have given rise to the fables alluded to in this poem.</p>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">Is</span> founded on a real fact, that happened in the island of
St. Christophers about the beginning of the present

physician in that island when this tragical incident happened, and
died there much honoured and lamented in 1767. To this ingenious
gentleman the public are indebted for the fine <i>Ode on Solitude</i>,
printed in the fourth vol. of Dodsley's <i>Miscel.</i> p. 229, in
which are assembled some of the sublimest images in nature.

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">Although</span> the English are remarkable for the number
and variety of their ancient ballads, and retain perhaps
a greater fondness for these old simple rhapsodies of
their ancestors, than most other nations; they are not
the only people who have distinguished themselves by compositions
of this kind. The Spaniards have great multitudes of them, many
of which are of the highest merit. They call them in their language
<i>Romances</i>, and have collected them into volumes under the
titles of <i>El Romancero</i>, <i>El Cancionero</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a> &amp;c. Most of them relate
to their conflicts with the Moors, and display a spirit of gallantry
peculiar to that romantic people. But of all the Spanish ballads
none exceed in poetical merit those inserted in a little Spanish
<i>History of the civil wars of Granada</i>, describing the dissensions
which raged in that last seat of Moorish empire before it was
conquered in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, in 1491. In this
history (or perhaps romance) a great number of heroic songs are
inserted and appealed to as authentic vouchers for the truth of
facts. In reality the prose narrative seems to be drawn up for no
other end, but to introduce and illustrate those beautiful pieces.</p>

<p>The Spanish editor pretends (how truly I know not) that they
are translations from the Arabic or Morisco language. Indeed,
from the plain unadorned nature of the verse, and the native
simplicity of the language and sentiment, which runs through these
poems, one would judge them to have been composed soon after
the conquest of Granada<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a> above mentioned; as the prose narrative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>in which they are inserted was published about a century after.
It should seem, at least, that they were written before the
Castillians had formed themselves so generally, as they have done
since, on the model of the Tuscan poets, or had imported from
Italy that fondness for conceit and refinement, which has for near
two centuries past so much infected the Spanish poetry, and
rendered it so frequently affected and obscure.</p>

<p>As a specimen of the ancient Spanish manner, which very much
resembles that of our English bards and minstrels, the reader is
desired candidly to accept the two following poems. They are
given from a small collection of pieces of this kind, which the
Editor some years ago translated for his amusement when he was
studying the Spanish language. As the first is a pretty close translation,
to gratify the curious it is accompanied with the original.
The metre is the same in all these old Spanish ballads: it is of the
most simple construction, and is still used by the common people
in their extemporaneous songs, as we learn from <i>Baretti's Travels</i>.
It runs in short stanzas of four lines, of which the second and
fourth alone correspond in their terminations; and in these it is
only required that the vowels should be alike, the consonants may
be altogether different, as</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="metre">
<tr>
  <td>pone</td>
  <td>casa</td>
  <td>meten</td>
  <td>arcos</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>noble</td>
  <td>ca&ntilde;as</td>
  <td>muere</td>
  <td>gamo</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Yet has this kind of verse a sort of simple harmonious flow, which
atones for the imperfect nature of the rhyme, and renders it not
unpleasing to the ear. The same flow of numbers has been
studied in the following versions. The first of them is given from
two different originals, both of which are printed in the <i>Hist. de las</i>
<i>civiles guerras de Granada</i>, Mad. 1694. One of them hath the
rhymes ending in <i>aa</i>, the other in <i>ia</i>. It is the former of these
that is here reprinted. They both of them begin with the same
line:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rio verde, rio verde,"<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which could not be translated faithfully:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Verdant river, verdant river,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>would have given an affected stiffness to the verse; the great merit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>of which is easy simplicity; and therefore a more simple epithet
was adopted, though less poetical or expressive.</p>

in the middle ages, who subsisted by
the arts of poetry and music, and sang
to the harp verses composed by themselves,
or others.<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> They also appear to have accompanied
their songs with mimicry and action;
and to have practised such various means of diverting
as were much admired in those rude times, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>supplied the want of more refined entertainment.<a name="FNanchor_B_1104" id="FNanchor_B_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_1104" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
These arts rendered them extremely popular and
acceptable in this and all the neighbouring countries;
where no high scene of festivity was esteemed complete,
that was not set off with the exercise of their
talents; and where, so long as the spirit of chivalry
subsisted, they were protected and caressed, because
their songs tended to do honour to the ruling passion
of the times, and to encourage and foment a martial
spirit.</p>

<p>The Minstrels seem to have been the genuine
successors of the ancient Bards,<a name="FNanchor_C_1105" id="FNanchor_C_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_1105" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> who under different
names were admired and revered, from the
earliest ages, among the people of Gaul, Britain,
Ireland, and the North; and indeed by almost all
the first inhabitants of Europe, whether of Celtic or
Gothic race;<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> but by none more than by our own
Teutonic ancestors,<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> particularly by all the Danish
tribes.<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> Among these they were distinguished by
the name of Scalds, a word which denotes "Smoothers
and Polishers of language."<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> The origin of their
art was attributed to Odin or Woden, the father of
their gods; and the professors of it were held in the
highest estimation. Their skill was considered as
something divine; their persons were deemed sacred;
their attendance was solicited by kings; and they
were everywhere loaded with honours and rewards.
In short, Poets and their art were held among them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>in that rude admiration, which is ever shewn by an
ignorant people to such as excel them in intellectual
accomplishments.</p>

<p>As these honours were paid to Poetry and Song,
from the earliest times, in those countries which our
Anglo-Saxon ancestors inhabited before their removal
into Britain, we may reasonably conclude that they
would not lay aside all their regard for men of this
sort immediately on quitting their German forests.
At least so long as they retained their ancient manners
and opinions, they would still hold them in high
estimation. But as the Saxons, soon after their establishment
in this island, were converted to Christianity;
in proportion as literature prevailed among
them, this rude admiration would begin to abate, and
Poetry would be no longer a peculiar profession.
Thus the Poet and the Minstrel early with us became
two persons.<a name="FNanchor_D_1106" id="FNanchor_D_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_1106" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> Poetry was cultivated by
men of letters indiscriminately, and many of the most
popular rhymes were composed amidst the leisure
and retirement of monasteries. But the Minstrels
continued a distinct order of men for many ages after
the Norman Conquest, and got their livelihood by
singing verses to the harp at the houses of the
great.<a name="FNanchor_E_1107" id="FNanchor_E_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_1107" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> There they were still hospitably and respectfully
received, and retained many of the honours
shewn to their predecessors, the Bards and Scalds.<a name="FNanchor_F_1108" id="FNanchor_F_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_1108" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>
And though, as their art declined, many of them only
recited the compositions of others, some of them still
composed songs themselves, and all of them could
probably invent a few stanzas on occasion. I have
no doubt but most of the old heroic ballads in this
collection were composed by this order of men; for
although some of the larger metrical romances might
come from the pen of the monks or others, yet the
smaller narratives were probably composed by the
minstrels who sang them. From the amazing varia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>tions
which occur in different copies of the old pieces,
it is evident they made no scruple to alter each
other's productions; and the reciter added or omitted
whole stanzas according to his own fancy or convenience.</p>

<p>In the early ages, as was hinted above, the profession
of oral itinerant poet was held in the utmost
reverence among all the Danish tribes; and therefore
we might have concluded that it was not unknown or
unrespected among their Saxon brethren in Britain,
even if history had been altogether silent on this
subject. The original country of our Anglo-Saxon
ancestors is well known to have lien chiefly in the
Cimbric Chersonese, in the tracts of land since distinguished
by the name of Jutland, Angelen, and Holstein.<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a>
The Jutes and Angles in particular, who
composed two-thirds of the conquerors of Britain,
were a Danish people, and their country at this day
belongs to the crown of Denmark;<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> so that when the
Danes again infested England, three or four hundred
years after, they made war on the descendants of
their own ancestors.<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> From this near affinity we
might expect to discover a strong resemblance between
both nations in their customs, manners, and
even language; and, in fact, we find them to differ
no more than would naturally happen between a
parent country and its own colonies, that had been
severed in a rude, uncivilized state, and had dropt all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>intercourse for three or four centuries, especially if we
reflect that the colony here settled had adopted a
new religion, extremely opposite in all respects to the
ancient paganism of the mother country; and that
even at first, along with the original Angli, had been
incorporated a large mixture of Saxons from the
neighbouring parts of Germany; and afterwards,
among the Danish invaders, had come vast multitudes
of adventurers from the more northern parts of
Scandinavia. But all these were only different tribes
of the same common Teutonic stock, and spoke only
different dialects of the same Gothic language.<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a></p>

<p>From this sameness of original and similarity of
manners we might justly have wondered if a character
so dignified and distinguished among the ancient
Danes as the Scald or Bard, had been totally unknown
or unregarded in this sister nation. And,
indeed, this argument is so strong, and, at the same
time, the early annals of the Anglo-Saxons are so
scanty and defective,<a name="FNanchor_G_1109" id="FNanchor_G_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_1109" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> that no objections from
their silence could be sufficient to overthrow it. For
if these popular bards were confessedly revered and
admired in those very countries which the Anglo-Saxons
inhabited before their removal into Britain,
and if they were afterwards common and numerous
among the other descendants of the same Teutonic
ancestors, can we do otherwise than conclude that
men of this order accompanied such tribes as migrated
hither, that they afterwards subsisted here,
though perhaps with less splendor than in the
North, and that there never was wanting a succession
of them to hand down the art, though some particular
conjunctures may have rendered it more respectable
at one time than another? And this was
evidently the case; for though much greater honours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>seem to have been heaped upon the northern Scalds,
in whom the characters of historian, genealogist, poet,
and musician were all united, than appear to have
been paid to the minstrels and harpers<a name="FNanchor_H_1110" id="FNanchor_H_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_1110" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> of the
Anglo-Saxons, whose talents were chiefly calculated
to entertain and divert, while the Scalds professed to
inform and instruct, and were at once the moralists
and theologues of their pagan countrymen. Yet the
Anglo-Saxon minstrels continued to possess no small
portion of public favour, and the arts they professed
were so extremely acceptable to our ancestors that
the word "Glee," which particularly denoted their
art, continues still in our own language to be of all
others the most expressive of that popular mirth and
jollity, that strong sensation of delight, which is felt
by unpolished and simple minds.<a name="FNanchor_I_1111" id="FNanchor_I_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_1111" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>II. Having premised these general considerations,
I shall now proceed to collect from history such
particular incidents as occur on this subject; and,
whether the facts themselves are true or not, they
are related by authors who lived too near the Saxon
times, and had before them too many recent monuments
of the Anglo-Saxon nation, not to know what
was conformable to the genius and manners of that
people; and therefore we may presume that their
relations prove at least the existence of the customs
and habits they attribute to our forefathers before
the Conquest, whatever becomes of the particular incidents
and events themselves. If this be admitted,
we shall not want sufficient proofs to show that minstrelsy
and song were not extinct among the Anglo-Saxons,
and that the professor of them here, if not
quite so respectable a personage as the Danish Scald,
was yet highly favoured and protected, and continued
still to enjoy considerable privileges.</p>

<p>Even so early as the first invasion of Britain by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
the Saxons an incident is recorded to have happened,
which, if true, shews that the minstrel or bard was
not unknown among this people, and that their
princes themselves could, upon occasion, assume that
character. Colgrin, son of that Ella who was elected
king or leader of the Saxons in the room of Hengist,<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a>
was shut up in York, and closely besieged by Arthur
and his Britons. Baldulph, brother of Colgrin,
wanted to gain access to him, and to apprize him of
a reinforcement which was coming from Germany.
He had no other way to accomplish his design but
to assume the character of a minstrel. He therefore
shaved his head and beard, and dressing himself in
the habit of that profession, took his harp in his hand.
In this disguise he walked up and down the trenches
without suspicion, playing all the while upon his
instrument as an harper. By little and little he
advanced near to the walls of the city, and, making
himself known to the sentinels, was in the night
drawn up by a rope.</p>

<p>Although the above fact comes only from the
suspicious pen of Geoffry of Monmouth,<a name="FNanchor_K_1112" id="FNanchor_K_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_1112" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> the judicious
reader will not too hastily reject it, because, if such a
fact really happened, it could only be known to us
through the medium of the British writers: for the
first Saxons, a martial but unlettered people, had no
historians of their own; and Geoffry, with all his
fables, is allowed to have recorded many true events
that have escaped other annalists.</p>

<p>We do not, however, want instances of a less fabulous
&aelig;ra, and more indubitable authority: for later
history affords us two remarkable facts,<a name="FNanchor_L_1113" id="FNanchor_L_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_1113" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> which I
think clearly shew that the same arts of poetry and
song, which were so much admired among the Danes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>were by no means unknown or neglected in this sister
nation, and that the privileges and honours which
were so lavishly bestowed upon the northern Scalds,
were not wholly withheld from the Anglo-Saxon
minstrels.</p>

<p>Our great King Alfred, who is expressly said to
have excelled in music,<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> being desirous to learn the
true situation of the Danish army, which had invaded
his realm, assumed the dress and character of a
minstrel,<a name="FNanchor_M_1114" id="FNanchor_M_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_1114" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> when, taking his harp, and one of the most
trusty of his friends disguised as a servant<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> (for in
the early times it was not unusual for a minstrel to
have a servant to carry his harp), he went with the
utmost security into the Danish camp; and, though
he could not but be known to be a Saxon by his dialect,
the character he had assumed procured him a
hospitable reception. He was admitted to entertain
the king at table, and staid among them long enough
to contrive that assault which afterwards destroyed
them. This was in the year 878.</p>

<p>About fifty years after,<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> a Danish king made use
of the same disguise to explore the camp of our king
Athelstan. With his harp in his hand, and dressed
like a minstrel,<a name="FNanchor_N_1115" id="FNanchor_N_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_1115" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> Aulaff,<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a> king of the Danes, went
among the Saxon tents; and, taking his stand near
the king's pavilion, began to play, and was immediately
admitted. There he entertained Athelstan
and his lords with his singing and his music, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>at length dismissed with an honourable reward,
though his songs must have discovered him to have
been a Dane.<a name="FNanchor_O_1116" id="FNanchor_O_1116"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_1116" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> Athelstan was saved from the
consequences of this stratagem by a soldier, who had
observed Aulaff bury the money which had been
given him, either from some scruple of honour or
motive of superstition. This occasioned a discovery.</p>

<p>Now, if the Saxons had not been accustomed to
have minstrels of their own, Alfred's assuming so new
and unusual a character would have excited suspicions
among the Danes. On the other hand, if it had not
been customary with the Saxons to shew favour and
respect to the Danish Scalds, Aulaff would not have
ventured himself among them, especially on the eve
of a battle.<a name="FNanchor_P_1117" id="FNanchor_P_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_1117" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> From the uniform procedure, then, of
both these kings, we may fairly conclude that the
same mode of entertainment prevailed among both
people, and that the minstrel was a privileged character
with each.</p>

<p>But if these facts had never existed, it can be
proved from undoubted records that the minstrel was
a regular and stated officer in the court of our Anglo-Saxon
kings: for in Doomesday book, "Joculator
Regis," the king's minstrel, is expressly mentioned in
Gloucestershire, in which county it should seem that
he had lands assigned him for his maintenance.<a name="FNanchor_Q_1118" id="FNanchor_Q_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_1118" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>III. We have now brought the inquiry down to
the Norman Conquest; and as the Normans had
been a late colony from Norway and Denmark,
where the Scalds had arrived to the highest pitch of
credit before Rollo's expedition into France, we
cannot doubt but this adventurer, like the other
northern princes, had many of these men in his train,
who settled with him in his new duchy of Normandy,
and left behind them successors in their art; so that
when his descendant, William the Bastard, invaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
this kingdom in the following century,<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> that mode of
entertainment could not but be still familiar with the
Normans. And that this is not mere conjecture will
appear from a remarkable fact, which shews that the
arts of poetry and song were still as reputable among
the Normans in France as they had been among
their ancestors in the north; and that the profession
of Minstrel, like that of Scald, was still aspired to by
the most gallant soldiers. In William's army was a
valiant warrior, named Taillefer, who was distinguished
no less for the minstrel-arts,<a name="FNanchor_R_1119" id="FNanchor_R_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_1119" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> than for his
courage and intrepidity. This man asked leave of
his commander to begin the onset, and obtained it.
He accordingly advanced before the army, and with
a loud voice animated his countrymen with songs in
praise of Charlemagne and Roland, and other heroes
of France; then rushing among the thickest of the
English, and valiantly fighting, lost his life.</p>

<p>Indeed, the Normans were so early distinguished
for their minstrel-talents, that an eminent French
writer<a name="FNanchor_S_1120" id="FNanchor_S_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_1120" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> makes no scruple to refer to them the
origin of all modern poetry, and shews that they
were celebrated for their songs near a century before
the troubadours of Provence, who are supposed to
have led the way to the poets of Italy, France, and
Spain.<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>

<p>We see then that the Norman Conquest was rather
likely to favour the establishment of the minstrel
profession in this kingdom, than to suppress it: and
although the favour of the Norman conquerors would
be probably confined to such of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
countrymen as excelled in the minstrel arts&mdash;and in the
first ages after the Conquest, no other songs would
be listened to by the great nobility but such as were
composed in their own Norman French&mdash;yet as the
great mass of the original inhabitants were not extirpated,
these could only understand their own native
gleemen or minstrels; who must still be allowed
to exist, unless it can be proved that they were all
proscribed and massacred, as, it is said, the Welsh
Bards were afterwards by the severe policy of King
Edward I. But this we know was not the case;
and even the cruel attempts of that monarch, as we
shall see below, proved ineffectual.<a name="FNanchor_S2_1121" id="FNanchor_S2_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_S2_1121" class="fnanchor">[S2]</a></p>

<p>The honours shewn to the Norman or French
minstrels by our princes and great barons, would
naturally have been imitated by their English
vassals and tenants, even if no favour or distinction
had ever been shewn here to the same
order of men, in the Anglo-Saxon and Danish
reigns. So that we cannot doubt but the English
harper and songster would, at least in a subordinate
degree, enjoy the same kind of honours, and be
received with similar respect among the inferior
English gentry and populace. I must be allowed,
therefore, to consider them as belonging to the
same community, as subordinate members at least
of the same college; and therefore, in gleaning the
scanty materials for this slight history, I shall collect
whatever incidents I can find relating to minstrels
and their art, and arrange them, as they occur in
our own annals, without distinction, as it will not
always be easy to ascertain, from the slight mention
of them by our regular historians, whether the artists
were Norman or English; for it need not be remarked
that subjects of this trivial nature are but
incidentally mentioned by our ancient annalists, and
were fastidiously rejected by other grave and serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
writers; so that, unless they were accidentally connected
with such events as became recorded in history,
they would pass unnoticed through the lapse
of ages, and be as unknown to posterity as other
topics relating to the private life and amusements
of the greatest nations.</p>

<p>On this account it can hardly be expected that we
should be able to produce regular and unbroken
annals of the minstrel art and its professors, or
have sufficient information whether every minstrel
or harper composed himself, or only repeated, the
songs he chanted. Some probably did the one,
and some the other: and it would have been
wonderful indeed if men whose peculiar profession
it was, and who devoted their time and talents
to entertain their hearers with poetical compositions,
were peculiarly deprived of all poetical genius
themselves, and had been under a physical incapacity
of composing those common popular rhymes
which were the usual subjects of their recitation.
Whoever examines any considerable quantity of
these, finds them in style and colouring as different
from the elaborate production of the sedentary composer
at his desk or in his cell, as the rambling
harper or minstrel was remote in his modes of life
and habits of thinking from the retired scholar, or
the solitary monk.<a name="FNanchor_T_1122" id="FNanchor_T_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_1122" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<p>It is well known that on the Continent, whence
our Norman nobles came, the bard who composed,
the harper who played and sang, and even the
dancer and the mimic, were all considered as of one
community, and were even all included under the
common name of Minstrels.<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> I must therefore be
allowed the same application of the term here
without being expected to prove that every singer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>composed, or every composer chanted, his own song;
much less that every one excelled in all the arts,
which were occasionally exercised by some or other
of this fraternity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>IV. After the Norman Conquest, the first occurrence
which I have met with relating to this order
of men is the founding of a priory and hospital by
one of them: scil. the Priory and Hospital of St.
Bartholomew, in Smithfield, London, by Royer or
Raherus, the King's Minstrel, in the third year of
King Henry I. <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1102. He was the first prior
of his own establishment, and presided over it to
the time of his death.<a name="FNanchor_T2_1123" id="FNanchor_T2_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_T2_1123" class="fnanchor">[T2]</a></p>

<p>In the reign of K. Henry II. we have upon
record the name of Galfrid or Jeffrey, a harper,
who in 1180 received a corrody or annuity from
the Abbey of Hide, near Winchester: and, as in
the early times every harper was expected to sing,
we cannot doubt but this reward was given to him
for his music and his songs; which, if they were for
the solace of the monks there, we may conclude
would be in the English language.<a name="FNanchor_U_1124" id="FNanchor_U_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_1124" class="fnanchor">[U]</a></p>

<p>Under his romantic son, K. Richard I., the minstrel
profession seems to have acquired additional
splendor. Richard, who was the great hero of
chivalry, was also the distinguished patron of poets
and minstrels. He was himself of their number,
and some of his poems are still extant.<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> They were
no less patronized by his favourites and chief officers.
His Chancellor, William Bishop of Ely, is expressly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>mentioned to have invited singers and minstrels
from France, whom he loaded with rewards; and
they in return celebrated him as the most accomplished
person in the world.<a name="FNanchor_U2_1125" id="FNanchor_U2_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_U2_1125" class="fnanchor">[U2]</a> This high
distinction and regard, although confined, perhaps,
in the first instance to poets and songsters of the
French nation, must have had a tendency to do
honour to poetry and song among all his subjects,
and to encourage the cultivation of these arts among
the natives, as the indulgent favour shewn by the
monarch or his great courtiers to the Proven&ccedil;al
<i>Troubadour</i>, or Norman <i>Rymour</i>, would naturally
be imitated by their inferior vassals to the English
gleeman or minstrel. At more than a century after
the Conquest, the national distinctions must have
begun to decline, and both the Norman and English
languages would be heard in the houses of the
great<a name="FNanchor_U3_1126" id="FNanchor_U3_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_U3_1126" class="fnanchor">[U3]</a>; so that probably about this &aelig;ra, or soon
after, we are to date that remarkable intercommunity
and exchange of each other's compositions which we
discover to have taken place at some early period
between the French and English minstrels: the
same set of phrases, the same species of characters,
incidents, and adventures, and often the same identical
stories being found in the old metrical romances
of both nations.<a name="FNanchor_V_1127" id="FNanchor_V_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_1127" class="fnanchor">[V]</a></p>

<p>The distinguished service which Richard received
from one of his own minstrels, in rescuing him from
his cruel and tedious captivity, is a remarkable fact,
which ought to be recorded for the honour of poets
and their art. This fact I shall relate in the following
words of an ancient writer.<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>
<p>"The Englishmen were more then a whole yeare,
without hearing any tydings of their king, or in what
place he was kept prisoner. He had trained up in
his court a Rimer or Minstrill,<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> called Blondell de
Nesle: who (so saith the Manuscript of old Poesies,<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>
and an auncient manuscript French Chronicle) being
so long without the sight of his lord, his life seemed
wearisome to him, and he became confounded with
melancholly. Knowne it was, that he came backe
from the Holy Land: but none could tell in what
countrey he arrived. Whereupon this Blondel, resolving
to make search for him in many countries,
but he would heare some newes of him; after expence
of divers dayes in travaile, he came to a
towne<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> (by good hap) neere to the castell where
his maister king Richard was kept. Of his host
he demanded to whom the castell appertained, and
the host told him, that it belonged to the duke
of Austria. Then he enquired whether there were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>any prisoners therein detained or no: for alwayes
he made such secret questionings wheresoever he
came. And the hoste gave answer, there was one
onely prisoner, but he knew not what he was, and
yet he had bin detained there more then the space
of a yeare. When Blondel heard this, he wrought
such meanes, that he became acquainted with them
of the castell, <i>as Minstrels doe easily win acquaintance</i>
<i>any where</i>:<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> but see the king he could not,
neither understand that it was he. One day he sat
directly before a window of the castell, where king
Richard was kept prisoner, and began to sing a song
in French, which king Richard and Blondel had
sometime composed together. When king Richard
heard the song, he knew it was Blondel that sung
it: and when Blondel paused at halfe of the song,
the king '<i>began the other half and completed it</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a>
Thus Blondel won knowledge of the king his
maister, and returning home into England, made
the barons of the countrie acquainted where the
king was." This happened about the year 1193.</p>

<p>The following old Proven&ccedil;al lines are given as
the very original song:<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> which I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>

<p>The access which Blondel so readily obtained in
the privileged character of a minstrel, is not the
only instance upon record of the same nature.<a name="FNanchor_V2_1128" id="FNanchor_V2_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_V2_1128" class="fnanchor">[V2]</a>
In this very reign of K. Richard I. the
young heiress of D'Evreux, Earl of Salisbury, had
been carried abroad and secreted by her French
relations in Normandy. To discover the place of
her concealment, a knight of the Talbot family spent
two years in exploring that province: at first under
the disguise of a pilgrim, till having found where
she was confined, in order to gain admittance he
assumed the dress and character of a harper, and
being a jocose person exceedingly skilled in "the
Gests of the ancients"<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>&mdash;so they called the romances
and stories which were the delight of that
age&mdash;he was gladly received into the family, whence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>he took an opportunity to carry off the young lady,
whom he presented to the king; and he bestowed
her on his natural brother William Longespee (son
of fair Rosamond), who became in her right Earl of
Salisbury. <a name="FNanchor_V3_1129" id="FNanchor_V3_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_V3_1129" class="fnanchor">[V3]</a></p>

<p>The next memorable event which I find in history,
reflects credit on the English minstrels; and
this was their contributing to the rescue of one of
the great Earls of Chester when besieged by the
Welsh. This happened in the reign of K. John,
and is related to this effect:<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>Hugh the first Earl of Chester, in his charter of
foundation of St. Werburg's Abbey in that city, had
granted such a privilege to those, who should come
to Chester fair, that they should not be then
apprehended for theft or any other misdemeanor, except
the crime were committed during the fair. This
special protection, occasioning a multitude of loose
people to resort to that fair, was afterwards of signal
benefit to one of his successors. For Ranulph the
last Earl of Chester, marching into Wales with a
slender attendance, was constrained to retire to his
castle of Rothelan (or Rhuydland) to which the
Welsh forthwith laid siege. In this distress he
sent for help to the Lord De Lacy, Constable of
Chester: "Who, making use of the minstrells of all
sorts, then met at Chester fair, by the allurement of
their musick, got together a vast number of such
loose people, as, by reason of the before specified
priviledge, were then in that city; whom he forthwith
sent under the conduct of Dutton (his steward),"
a gallant youth, who was also his son in law. The
Welsh, alarmed at the approach of this rabble,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>supposing them to be a regular body of armed and
disciplined veterans, instantly raised the siege and
retired.</p>

<p>For this good service Ranulph is said to have
granted to De Lacy by charter the patronage and
authority over the minstrels and the loose and inferior
people; who, retaining to himself that of the lower
artificers, conferred on Dutton the jurisdiction of the
minstrels and harlots:<a name="FNanchor_1059_1059" id="FNanchor_1059_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059_1059" class="fnanchor">[1059]</a> and under the descendants of
this family the minstrels enjoyed certain privileges,
and protection for many ages. For even so late as
the reign of Elizabeth, when this profession had fallen
into such discredit that it was considered in law as a
nuisance, the minstrels under the jurisdiction of the
family of Dutton are expressly excepted out of all
acts of parliament made for their suppression; and
have continued to be so excepted ever since.<a name="FNanchor_W_1130" id="FNanchor_W_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_1130" class="fnanchor">[W]</a></p>

<p>The ceremonies attending the exercise of this jurisdiction
are thus described by Dugdale<a name="FNanchor_1060_1060" id="FNanchor_1060_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060_1060" class="fnanchor">[1060]</a> as handed
down to his time, viz. "That at midsummer fair
there, all the minstrels of that countrey resorting to
Chester, do attend the heir of Dutton, from his lodging
to St. John's church (he being then accompanied by
many gentlemen of the countrey) one of 'the minstrels'
walking before him in a surcoat of his arms depicted
on taffata; the rest of his fellows proceeding (two and
two) and playing on their several sorts of musical
instruments. And after divine service ended, give
the like attendance on him back to his lodging; where
a court being kept by his (Mr. Dutton's) Steward,
and all the minstrels formally called, certain orders
and laws are usually made for the better government
of that Society, with penalties on those who
transgress."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same reign of K. John we have a remarkable
instance of a minstrel, who to his other talents
superadded the character of Soothsayer, and by his
skill in drugs and medicated potions was able to
rescue a knight from imprisonment. This occurs in
Leland's Narrative of the Gestes of Guarine (or
Warren) and his sons, which he "excerptid owte
of an old Englisch boke yn ryme,"<a name="FNanchor_1061_1061" id="FNanchor_1061_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061_1061" class="fnanchor">[1061]</a> and is as
follows:</p>

<p>Whitington Castle, in Shropshire, which together
with the coheiress of the original proprietor had been
won in a solemn turnament by the ancestor of the
Guarines,<a name="FNanchor_1062_1062" id="FNanchor_1062_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062_1062" class="fnanchor">[1062]</a> had in the reign of K. John been seized
by the Prince of Wales, and was afterwards possessed
by Morice, a retainer of that Prince, to whom the
king out of hatred to the true heir Fulco Guarine
(with whom he had formerly had a quarrel at Chess)<a name="FNanchor_1063_1063" id="FNanchor_1063_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063_1063" class="fnanchor">[1063]</a>
not only confirmed the possession, but also made
him governor of the marches, of which Fulco himself
had the custody in the time of K. Richard. The
Guarines demanded justice of the king, but obtaining
no gracious answer, renounced their allegiance and
fled into Bretagne. Returning into England, after
various conflicts, "Fulco resortid to one John of
Raumpayne, a Sothsayer and Jocular and Minstrelle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>and made hym his spy to Morice at Whitington."
The privileges of this character we have already seen,
and John so well availed himself of them, that in
consequence of the intelligence which he doubtless
procured, "Fulco, and his brethrene laide waite for
Morice, as he went toward Salesbyri, and Fulco
ther woundid hym: and Bracy" (a knight, who was
their friend and assistant), "cut of Morices&#769; hedde."
This sir Bracy being in a subsequent rencounter
sore wounded, was taken and brought to K. John;
from whose vengeance he was however rescued by
this notable minstrel; for "John Rampayne founde
the meanes to cast them, that kepte Bracy, into a
deadely slepe; and so he and Bracy cam to Fulco to
Whitington," which on the death of Morice had been
restored to him by the Prince of Wales. As no further
mention occurs of the minstrel, I might here
conclude this narrative; but I shall just add, that
Fulco was obliged to flee into France, where assuming
the name of Sir Amice, he distinguished himself
in justs and turnaments; and, after various romantic
adventures by sea and land (having in the true stile
of chivalry rescued "certayne ladies owt of prison"),
he finally obtained the king's pardon, and the quiet
possession of Whitington Castle.</p>

<p>In the reign of K. Henry III. we have mention of
Master Richard the King's harper, to whom in his
36th year (1252) that monarch gave not only forty
shillings, and a pipe of wine, but also a pipe of wine
to Beatrice his wife.<a name="FNanchor_1064_1064" id="FNanchor_1064_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064_1064" class="fnanchor">[1064]</a> The title of <i>magister</i>, or master,
given to this minstrel deserves notice, and shews
his respectable situation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span></p>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>V. The harper, or minstrel, was so necessary an
attendant on a royal personage, that Prince Edward
(afterwards K. Edward I.) in his Crusade to the
Holy Land, in 1271, was not without his harper,
who must have been officially very near his person,
as we are told by a contemporary historian<a name="FNanchor_1065_1065" id="FNanchor_1065_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065_1065" class="fnanchor">[1065]</a> that, in
the attempt to assassinate that heroic prince, when he
had wrested the poisoned knife out of the Sarazen's
hand and killed him with his own weapon, the
attendants, who had stood apart while he was whispering
to their master, hearing the struggle, ran to
his assistance, and one of them, to wit his harper,
seizing a tripod or trestle, struck the assassin on the
head and beat out his brains.<a name="FNanchor_1066_1066" id="FNanchor_1066_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066_1066" class="fnanchor">[1066]</a> And though the
Prince blamed him for striking the man after he was
dead, yet his near access shews the respectable
situation of this officer; and his affectionate zeal
should have induced Edward to entreat his brethren
the Welsh Bards afterwards with more lenity.</p>

<p>Whatever was the extent of this great monarch's
severity towards the professors of music and of song
in Wales; whether the executing by martial law such
of them as fell into his hands was only during the
heat of conflict, or was continued afterwards with more
systematic rigor;<a name="FNanchor_1067_1067" id="FNanchor_1067_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067_1067" class="fnanchor">[1067]</a> yet in his own court the minstrels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>appear to have been highly favoured; for when,
in 1306, he conferred the order of knighthood on
his son, and many others of the young nobility, a
multitude of minstrels were introduced to invite
and induce the new knights to make some military
vow.<a name="FNanchor_X_1131" id="FNanchor_X_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_1131" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> And</p>

<p>Under the succeeding reign of K. Edward II.
such extensive privileges were claimed by these
men, and by dissolute persons assuming their character,
that it became a matter of public grievance, and
was obliged to be reformed by an express regulation
in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1315.<a name="FNanchor_Y_1132" id="FNanchor_Y_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_1132" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> Notwithstanding which, an incident
is recorded in the ensuing year, which shews
that minstrels still retained the liberty of entering
at will into the royal presence, and had something
peculiarly splendid in their dress. It is thus related
by Stow.<a name="FNanchor_Z_1133" id="FNanchor_Z_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_1133" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a></p>

<p>"In the year 1316, Edward the second did solemnize
his feast of Pentecost at Westminster, in the
great hall: where sitting royally at the table with his
peers about him, there entered a woman <i>adorned like</i>
<i>a minstrel</i>, sitting on a great horse trapped, <i>as minstrels</i>
<i>then used</i>; who rode round about the tables,
shewing pastime; and at length came up to the king's
table, and laid before him a letter, and forthwith turning
her horse saluted every one and
departed."&mdash;&mdash;The subject of this letter was a remonstrance to the
king on the favours heaped by him on his minions,
to the neglect of his knights and faithful servants.</p>

<p>The privileged character of a minstrel was employed
on this occasion, as sure of gaining an easy
admittance; and a female the rather deputed to assume
it, that in case of detection, her sex might disarm the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>king's resentment. This is offered on a supposition,
that she was not a real minstrel; for there should
seem to have been women of this profession,<a name="FNanchor_AA_1134" id="FNanchor_AA_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA_1134" class="fnanchor">[Aa]</a>
as well as of the other sex; and no accomplishment
is so constantly attributed to females, by our
ancient bards, as their singing to and playing on
the harp.<a name="FNanchor_AA2_1135" id="FNanchor_AA2_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_AA2_1135" class="fnanchor">[Aa2]</a></p>

<p>In the fourth year of K. Richard II. John of Gaunt
erected at Tutbury in Staffordshire, a court of minstrels,
similar to that annually kept at Chester (p. 363),
and which, like a Court-Leet or Court-Baron, had a
legal jurisdiction, with full power to receive suit and
service from the men of this profession within five
neighbouring countries, to enact laws, and determine
their controversies; and to apprehend and arrest such
of them as should refuse to appear at the said court,
annually held on the 16th of August. For this they
had a charter by which they were empowered to
appoint a king of the minstrels, with four officers to
preside over them.<a name="FNanchor_BB_1136" id="FNanchor_BB_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB_1136" class="fnanchor">[Bb]</a> These were every year
elected with great ceremony; the whole form of which
as observed in 1680, is described by Dr. Plott:<a name="FNanchor_1068_1068" id="FNanchor_1068_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068_1068" class="fnanchor">[1068]</a> in
whose time however they appear to have lost their
singing talents, and to have confined all their skill to
"wind and string music."<a name="FNanchor_1069_1069" id="FNanchor_1069_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069_1069" class="fnanchor">[1069]</a></p>

<p>The minstrels seem to have been in many respects
upon the same footing as the heralds; and the king
of the minstrels, like the king at arms, was both here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>and on the Continent an usual officer in the courts of
princes. Thus we have in the reign of K. Edward
I. mention of a King Robert, and others. And in
16 Edw. II. is a grant to William de Morlee "the
king's Minstrel, stiled <i>Roy de North</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_1070_1070" id="FNanchor_1070_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070_1070" class="fnanchor">[1070]</a> of houses
which had belonged to another king, John le
Boteler.<a name="FNanchor_BB2_1137" id="FNanchor_BB2_1137"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB2_1137" class="fnanchor">[Bb2]</a> Rymer hath also printed a licence granted
by K. Richard II. in 1387, to John Caumz, the king
of his minstrels, to pass the seas, recommending him

and allies.<a name="FNanchor_1071_1071" id="FNanchor_1071_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071_1071" class="fnanchor">[1071]</a></p>

<p>In the subsequent reign of K. Henry IV. we meet
with no particulars relating to the minstrels in England,
but we find in the Statute Book a severe law
passed against their brethren the Welsh bards; whom
our ancestors could not distinguish from their own
<i>Rimours, Ministralx</i>; for by these names they describe
them.<a name="FNanchor_BB3_1138" id="FNanchor_BB3_1138"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB3_1138" class="fnanchor">[Bb3]</a> This act plainly shews that far
from being extirpated by the rigorous policy of K.
Edward I., this order of men were still able to
alarm the English government, which attributed to
them "many diseases and mischiefs in Wales," and
prohibited their meetings and contributions.</p>

<p>When his heroic son K. Henry V. was preparing
his great voyage for France in 1415, an express
order was given for his minstrels, fifteen in number, to
attend him:<a name="FNanchor_1072_1072" id="FNanchor_1072_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072_1072" class="fnanchor">[1072]</a> and eighteen are afterwards mentioned,
to each of whom he allowed xii<i>d.</i> a day, when that
sum must have been of more than ten times the value
it is at present.<a name="FNanchor_1073_1073" id="FNanchor_1073_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073_1073" class="fnanchor">[1073]</a> Yet when he entered London in
triumph after the battle of Agincourt, he, from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
principle of humility, slighted the pageants and verses
which were prepared to hail his return; and, as we
are told by Holinshed,<a name="FNanchor_1074_1074" id="FNanchor_1074_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074_1074" class="fnanchor">[1074]</a> would not suffer "any Dities
to be made and song by minstrels, of his glorious
victorie; for that he would whollie have the praise
and thankes altogether given to God."<a name="FNanchor_BB4_1139" id="FNanchor_BB4_1139"></a><a href="#Footnote_BB4_1139" class="fnanchor">[Bb4]</a> But
this did not proceed from any disregard for the
professors of music or of song; for at the feast of
Pentecost which he celebrated in 1416, having the
Emperor and the Duke of Holland for his guests, he
ordered rich gowns for sixteen of his minstrels, of
which the particulars are preserved by Rymer.<a name="FNanchor_1075_1075" id="FNanchor_1075_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075_1075" class="fnanchor">[1075]</a> And
having before his death orally granted an annuity of
100 shillings to each of his minstrels, the grant was
confirmed in the first year of his son K. Henry VI.,
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1423, and payment ordered out of the Exchequer.<a name="FNanchor_1076_1076" id="FNanchor_1076_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076_1076" class="fnanchor">[1076]</a></p>

<p>The unfortunate reign of K. Henry VI. affords
no occurrences respecting our subject; but in his 34th
year, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1456, we have in Rymer<a name="FNanchor_1077_1077" id="FNanchor_1077_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077_1077" class="fnanchor">[1077]</a> a commission
for impressing boys or youths, to supply vacancies by
death among the king's minstrels; in which it is
expressly directed that they shall be elegant in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>limbs, as well as instructed in the minstrel art, wherever
they can be found, for the solace of his Majesty.</p>

<p>In the following reign, K. Edward IV. (in his 9th
year, 1469) upon a complaint that certain rude husbandmen
and artificers of various trades had assumed
the title and livery of the king's minstrels, and under
that colour and pretence had collected money in diverse
parts of the kingdom and committed other disorders,
the king grants to Walter Haliday, Marshal,
and to seven others his own minstrels whom he names,
a charter,<a name="FNanchor_1078_1078" id="FNanchor_1078_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078_1078" class="fnanchor">[1078]</a> by which he creates, or rather restores a
fraternity or perpetual Gild (such, as he understands,
the brothers and sisters of the fraternity of minstrels
had in times past) to be governed by a Marshal appointed
for life and by two wardens to be chosen
annually; who are impowered to admit brothers and
sisters into the said Gild, and are authorized to examine
the pretensions of all such as affected to exercise
the minstrel profession; and to regulate, govern, and
punish them throughout the realm (those of Chester
excepted).&mdash;This seems to have some resemblance
to the Earl Marshal's Court among the heralds, and
is another proof of the great affinity and resemblance
which the minstrels bore to the members of the
College of Arms.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that Walter Haliday, whose name
occurs as marshal in the foregoing charter, had been
retained in the service of the two preceding monarchs,
K. Henry V.<a name="FNanchor_1079_1079" id="FNanchor_1079_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079_1079" class="fnanchor">[1079]</a> and VI.;<a name="FNanchor_1080_1080" id="FNanchor_1080_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080_1080" class="fnanchor">[1080]</a> nor is this the first time he
is mentioned as marshal of the king's minstrels, for
in the third year of this reign, 1464, he had a grant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>from K. Edward of ten marks per annum during life
directed to him with that title.<a name="FNanchor_1081_1081" id="FNanchor_1081_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081_1081" class="fnanchor">[1081]</a></p>

<p>But besides their marshal, we have also in this
reign mention of a Sergeant of the minstrels, who
upon a particular occasion was able to do his royal
master a singular service, wherein his confidential
situation and ready access to the king at all hours is
very apparent; for "as he [K. Edward IV.] was in
the north contray in the monneth of Septembre, as
he lay in his bedde, one namid Alexander Carlile,
that was <i>Sariaunt of the Mynstrellis</i>, cam to him in
grete hast, and badde hym aryse for he hadde enemyes
cummyng for to take him, the which were within vi.
or vii. mylis, of the which tydinges the king gretely
marveylid, &amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_1082_1082" id="FNanchor_1082_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082_1082" class="fnanchor">[1082]</a> This happened in the same year,
1469, wherein the king granted or confirmed the
charter for the fraternity or Gild above-mentioned;
yet this Alexander Carlisle is not one of the eight
minstrels to whom that charter is directed.<a name="FNanchor_1083_1083" id="FNanchor_1083_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083_1083" class="fnanchor">[1083]</a></p>

<p>The same charter was renewed by K. Henry VIII.
in 1520, to John Gilman his then marshal, and to
seven others his minstrels;<a name="FNanchor_1084_1084" id="FNanchor_1084_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084_1084" class="fnanchor">[1084]</a> and on the death of
Gilman he granted in 1529 this office of Marshal of
his minstrels to Hugh Wodehouse,<a name="FNanchor_1085_1085" id="FNanchor_1085_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085_1085" class="fnanchor">[1085]</a> whom I take to
have borne the office of his serjeant over them.<a name="FNanchor_1086_1086" id="FNanchor_1086_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086_1086" class="fnanchor">[1086]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>VI. In all the establishments of royal and noble
households, we find an ample provision made for the
minstrels; and their situation to have been both
honourable and lucrative. In proof of this it is
sufficient to refer to the Household Book of the Earl
of Northumberland, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1512.<a name="FNanchor_CC_1140" id="FNanchor_CC_1140"></a><a href="#Footnote_CC_1140" class="fnanchor">[Cc]</a> And the rewards
they received so frequently recur in ancient
writers that it is unnecessary to crowd the page with
them here.<a name="FNanchor_CC2_1141" id="FNanchor_CC2_1141"></a><a href="#Footnote_CC2_1141" class="fnanchor">[Cc2]</a></p>

<p>The name of minstrel seems however to have been
gradually appropriated to the musician only, especially
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; yet we
occasionally meet with applications of the term in its
more enlarged meaning as including the singer, if
not the composer of heroic or popular rhymes.<a name="FNanchor_1087_1087" id="FNanchor_1087_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087_1087" class="fnanchor">[1087]</a></p>

<p>In the time of K. Henry VIII. we find it to have
been a common entertainment to hear verses recited,
or moral speeches learned for that purpose, by a set
of men who got their livelihood by repeating them, and
who intruded without ceremony into all companies;
not only in taverns, but in the houses of the nobility
themselves. This we learn from Erasmus, whose
argument led him only to describe a species of these
men who <i>did not sing</i> their compositions; but the
others that <i>did</i>, enjoyed without doubt the same
privileges.<a name="FNanchor_DD_1142" id="FNanchor_DD_1142"></a><a href="#Footnote_DD_1142" class="fnanchor">[Dd]</a></p>

<p>For even long after, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth,
it was usual "in places of assembly" for the
company to be "desirous to heare of old adventures
and valiaunces of noble knights in times past, as
those of king Arthur, and his knights of the round
table, Sir Bevys of Southampton, Guy of Warwicke
and others like" in "short and long meetres, and by
breaches or divisions (sc. Fits)<a name="FNanchor_1088_1088" id="FNanchor_1088_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088_1088" class="fnanchor">[1088]</a> to be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
commodiously sung to the harpe," as the reader may be
informed by a courtly writer in 1589.<a name="FNanchor_1089_1089" id="FNanchor_1089_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089_1089" class="fnanchor">[1089]</a> Who himself
had "written for pleasure a litle brief romance
or historicall ditty ... of the Isle of Great Britaine"
in order to contribute to such entertainment. And
he subjoins this caution: "Such as have not premonition
hereof" (viz. that his poem was written in
short metre, &amp;c. to be sung to the harpe in such
places of assembly), "and consideration of the
causes alledged, would peradventure reprove and
disgrace every romance, or short historicall ditty for
that they be not written in long meeters or verses
Alexandrins," which constituted the prevailing versification
among the poets or that age, and which no
one now can endure to read.</p>

<p>And that the recital of such romances sung to the
harp was at that time the delight of the common
people, we are told by the same writer,<a name="FNanchor_1090_1090" id="FNanchor_1090_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090_1090" class="fnanchor">[1090]</a> who mentions
that "common rimers" were fond of using rimes at
short distances, "in small and popular musickes song
by these Cantabanqui" (the said common rimers)
"upon benches and barrels heads," &amp;c. "or else by
blind harpers or such like Taverne minstrels that
give a fit of mirth for a groat; and their matter being
for the most part stories of old time, as the Tale of
Sir Topas, the reportes of Bevis of Southampton, Guy
of Warwicke, Adam Bell, and Clymme of the Clough,
and such other old romances, or historicall rimes,"
&amp;c. "also they be used in carols and rounds, and such
light or lascivious poemes, which are commonly more
commodiously uttered by these buffons, or vices in
playes, then by any other person. Such were the
rimes of Skelton (usurping the name of a poet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
laureat) being in deede but a rude railing rimer, and all
his doings ridiculous."<a name="FNanchor_1091_1091" id="FNanchor_1091_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091_1091" class="fnanchor">[1091]</a></p>

<p>But although we find here that the minstrels had
lost much of their dignity, and were sinking into
contempt and neglect: yet that they still sustained a
character far superior to anything we can conceive at
present of the singers of old ballads, I think, may be
inferred from the following representation.</p>

<p>When Queen Elizabeth was entertained at Killingworth
Castle by the Earl of Leicester in 1575, among
the many devices and pageants which were contrived
for her entertainment, one of the personages introduced
was to have been that of an ancient minstrel:
whose appearance and dress are so minutely described
by a writer there present,<a name="FNanchor_1092_1092" id="FNanchor_1092_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092_1092" class="fnanchor">[1092]</a> and give us so distinct
an idea of the character, that I shall quote the
passage at large.<a name="FNanchor_EE_1143" id="FNanchor_EE_1143"></a><a href="#Footnote_EE_1143" class="fnanchor">[Ee]</a></p>

<p>"A person very meet seemed he for the purpose,
of a xlv years old, apparelled partly as he would
himself. His cap off; his head seemly rounded Tonsler
wise:<a name="FNanchor_1093_1093" id="FNanchor_1093_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093_1093" class="fnanchor">[1093]</a> fair kembed, that with a sponge daintily dipt
in a little capon's greace was finely smoothed, to
make it shine like a mallard's wing. His beard
smugly shaven: and yet his shirt after the new trink,
with ruffs fair starched, sleeked and glistering like a
pair of new shoes, marshalled in good order with a
setting stick, and strut, that every ruff stood up like
a wafer. A side (<i>i.e.</i> long) gown of Kendal green,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>after the freshness of the year now, gathered at the
neck with a narrow gorget, fastened afore with a
white clasp and a keeper close up to the chin; but
easily, for heat to undo when he list. Seemly
begirt in a red caddis girdle: from that a pair of
capped Sheffield knives hanging a' two sides. Out
of his bosom drawn forth a lappet of his napkin<a name="FNanchor_1094_1094" id="FNanchor_1094_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094_1094" class="fnanchor">[1094]</a>
edged with a blue lace, and marked with a true love,
a heart, and a D for Damian, for he was but a batchelor yet.</p>

<p>"His gown had side (<i>i.e.</i> long) sleeves down to
mid-leg, slit from the shoulder to the hand, and
lined with white cotton. His doublet-sleeves of black
worsted: upon them a pair of poynets<a name="FNanchor_1095_1095" id="FNanchor_1095_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095_1095" class="fnanchor">[1095]</a> of tawny
chamlet laced along the wrist with blue threaden
points, a wealt towards the hand of fustian-a-napes.
A pair of red neather stocks. A pair of pumps on his
feet, with a cross cut at the toes for corns: not new
indeed, yet cleanly blackt with soot, and shining as a
shoing horn.</p>

<p>"About his neck a red ribband suitable to his
girdle. His harp in good grace dependent before
him. His wrest<a name="FNanchor_1096_1096" id="FNanchor_1096_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096_1096" class="fnanchor">[1096]</a> tyed to a green lace and hanging
by. Under the gorget of his gown a fair flaggon
chain (pewter,<a name="FNanchor_1097_1097" id="FNanchor_1097_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097_1097" class="fnanchor">[1097]</a> for) silver, as a squire minstrel of
Middlesex, that travelled the country this summer
season, unto fairs and worshipful mens houses.
From his chain hung a scutcheon, with metal and
colour, resplendant upon his breast, of the ancient
arms of Islington."</p>

<p>This minstrel is described as belonging to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>village. I suppose such as were retained by noble
families wore the arms of their patrons hanging
down by a silver chain as a kind of badge.<a name="FNanchor_1098_1098" id="FNanchor_1098_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098_1098" class="fnanchor">[1098]</a> From
the expression of squire minstrel above, we may
conclude there were other inferior orders, as yeomen
minstrels or the like.</p>

<p>This minstrel, the author tells us a little below,
"after three lowly courtsies, cleared his voice with a
hem ... and ... wiped his lips with the hollow
of his hand for 'filing his napkin, tempered a string
or two with his wrest, and after a little warbling on
his harp for a prelude, came forth with a solemn
song, warranted for story out of King Arthur's acts,
&amp;c." This song the reader will find printed in this
work, vol. iii. book i. No. 3.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the sixteenth century this
class of men had lost all credit, and were sunk so
low in the public opinion, that in the 39th year of
Elizabeth,<a name="FNanchor_1099_1099" id="FNanchor_1099_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099_1099" class="fnanchor">[1099]</a> a statute was passed by which "minstrels,
wandering abroad," were included among "rogues,
vagabonds, and sturdy beggars," and were adjudged
to be punished as such. This act seems to have put
an end to the profession.<a name="FNanchor_EE2_1144" id="FNanchor_EE2_1144"></a><a href="#Footnote_EE2_1144" class="fnanchor">[Ee2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>VII. I cannot conclude this account of the ancient
English minstrels, without remarking that they are
most of them represented to have been of the North
of England. There is scarce an old historical song
or ballad <a name="FNanchor_FF_1145" id="FNanchor_FF_1145"></a><a href="#Footnote_FF_1145" class="fnanchor">[Ff]</a> wherein a minstrel or harper appears,
but he is characterized by way of eminence to have
been "of the North countreye:"<a name="FNanchor_1100_1100" id="FNanchor_1100_1100"></a><a href="#Footnote_1100_1100" class="fnanchor">[1100]</a> and, indeed, the
prevalence of the Northern dialect in such compositions
shews that this representation is real.<a name="FNanchor_1101_1101" id="FNanchor_1101_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101_1101" class="fnanchor">[1101]</a> On
the other hand, the scene of the finest Scottish
ballads is laid in the south of Scotland; which should
seem to have been peculiarly the nursery of Scottish
minstrels. In the old song of Maggy Lawder, a
piper is asked, by way of distinction, "Come ye frae
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>the Border?"<a name="FNanchor_1102_1102" id="FNanchor_1102_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102_1102" class="fnanchor">[1102]</a> The martial spirit constantly kept
up and exercised near the frontier of the two kingdoms,
as it furnished continual subjects for their
songs, so it inspired the inhabitants of the adjacent
counties on both sides with the powers of poetry.
Besides, as our southern metropolis must have been
ever the scene of novelty and refinement, the northern
countries, as being most distant, would preserve
their ancient manners longest, and, of course, the
old poetry, in which those manners are peculiarly described.</p>

<p>The reader will observe in the more ancient ballads
of this collection, a cast of style and measure
very different from that of contemporary poets of a
higher class; many phrases and idioms, which the
minstrels seem to have appropriated to themselves,
and a very remarkable licence of varying the accent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>of words at pleasure, in order to humour the flow of
the verse, particularly in the rhimes; as</p>




<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="rhimes">
<tr>
  <td><i>Countr&igrave;e</i></td>
  <td><i>harp&egrave;r</i></td>
  <td><i>batt&egrave;l</i></td>

</table>

<p>instead of <i>co&ugrave;ntry</i>, <i>l&agrave;dy</i>, <i>h&agrave;rper</i>, <i>s&igrave;nger</i>, &amp;c. This
liberty is but sparingly assumed by the classical
poets of the same age; or even by the latter composers
of heroical ballads, I mean by such as professedly
wrote for the press. For it is to be observed,
that so long as the minstrels subsisted, they
seem never to have designed their rhymes for literary
publication, and probably never committed them
to writing themselves; what copies are preserved of
them were doubtless taken down from their mouths.
But as the old minstrels gradually wore out, a new
race of ballad-writers succeeded, an inferior sort of
minor poets, who wrote narrative songs merely for
the press. Instances of both may be found in the
reign of Elizabeth. The two latest pieces in the
genuine strain of the old minstrelsy that I can discover
are No. 3 and 4 of book iii. in this volume.
Lower than these I cannot trace the old mode of
writing.</p>

<p>The old minstrel ballads are in the northern
dialect, abound with antique words and phrases, are
extremely incorrect, and run into the utmost licence
of metre; they have also a romantic wildness, and
are in the true spirit of chivalry. The other sort
are written in exacter measure, have a low or subordinate
correctness, sometimes bordering on the insipid,
yet often well adapted to the pathetic; these
are generally in the southern dialect, exhibit a more
modern phraseology, and are commonly descriptive
of more modern manners. To be sensible of the
difference between them, let the reader compare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
in this volume No. 3 of book iii. with No. 11 of
book ii.</p>

<p>Towards the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign (as
is mentioned above), the genuine old minstrelsy
seems to have been extinct, and henceforth the ballads
that were produced were wholly of the latter
kind, and these came forth in such abundance that
in the reign of James I. they began to be collected
into little miscellanies, under the name of Garlands,
and at length to be written purposely for such collections.

Wodehous, in the original Grant (see Rymer, <i>ubi supra</i>). It is
needless to observe that <i>Serviens</i> expressed a serjeant as well as a
servant. If this interpretation of <i>Serviens</i> be allowed, it will account
for his placing Wodehouse at the head of his Gild, although he
had not been one of the eight minstrels who had had the general
direction. The serjeant of his minstrells, we may presume, was
next in dignity to the marshal, although he had no share in the
government of the Gild.</p></div>

barony of Rothbury. These attend the court leets and fairs held

smaller; and blown, not with the breath, but with a small pair of

mentions a very extraordinary habit or propensity, which then
prevailed in the north of England, beyond the Humber, for
"symphonious harmony," or singing "in two parts, the one murmuring
in the base, and the other warbling in the acute or treble." (I use
Dr. Burney's version, vol. ii. p. 108.) This he describes as
practised by their very children from the cradle; and he derives it
from the Danes (so <i>Daci</i> signifies in our old writers) and Norwegians,
who long over-ran and in effect new-peopled the northern
parts of England, where alone this manner of singing prevailed.
(Vide <i>Cambriae Descriptio</i>, cap. 13, and in Burney, <i>ubi supra</i>.) Giraldus is probably right as to the origin or derivation of this practise, for the Danish and Icelandic scalds had carried the arts of poetry and singing to great perfection at the time the Danish
settlements were made in the north. And it will also help to
account for the superior skill and fame of our northern minstrels
and harpers afterwards: who had preserved and transmitted the
arts of their scaldic ancestors. See <i>Northern Antiquities</i>, vol. i. c.
13, p. 386, and <i>Five pieces of Runic poetry</i>, 1763, 8vo. Compare
the original passage in Giraldus, as given by Sir John Hawkins, i.
408, and by Dr. Burney, ii. 108, who are both at a loss to account
for this peculiarity, and therefore doubt the fact. The credit of
Giraldus, which hath been attacked by some partial and bigotted
antiquaries, the reader will find defended in that learned and curious
work, <i>Antiquities of Ireland</i>, by Edward Ledwich, LL.D. &amp;c. Dublin,
1790, 4to. p. 207, &amp; seqq.</p></div>

wastes reach almost across the island, scarcely inhabited by any
but solitary shepherds; many of whom durst not venture into the
opposite border on account of the ancient feuds and subsequent
disputes concerning the Debatable Lands, which separated the
boundaries of the two kingdoms, as well as the estates of the two
great families of Percy and Douglas; till these disputes were settled,
not many years since, by arbitration between the <i>present</i> Lord
Douglas, and the <i>late</i> Duke and Dutchess of Northumberland.</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-capa"><span class="smcap">The</span> word <i>minstrel</i> does not appear to have been in use
here before the Norman Conquest: whereas it had
long before that time been adopted in France.<a name="FNanchor_1103_1148" id="FNanchor_1103_1148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103_1148" class="fnanchor">[1103]</a> Menestrel,
so early as the eighth century, was a title given
to the <i>Maestro di Capella</i> of K. Pepin, the father of Charlemagne;
and afterwards to the Coryph&aelig;us, or leader of any band of musicians
(v. Burney's <i>Hist. of Music</i>, ii. 268). This term <i>menestrel</i>,
<i>menestrier</i> was thus expressed in Latin, <i>ministellus</i>, <i>ministrellus</i>,
<i>ministrallus</i>, <i>menesterellus</i>, &amp;c. (Vid. <i>Gloss. Du Cange</i>, and Supplement.)
</p>
<p>
Menage derives the French words above mentioned from <i>ministerialis</i>
or <i>ministeriarius</i>, barbarous Latin terms, used in the middle
ages to express a workman or artificer (still called in Languedoc
<i>ministral</i>), as if these men were styled artificers or performers by
way of excellence (vid. <i>Diction. Etym.</i>) But the origin of the
name is given perhaps more truly by Du Cange, "Ministelli ...
quos vulgo <i>menestreux</i> vel <i>menestriers</i> appellamus, quod minoribus
aul&aelig; <i>ministris</i> accenserentur." (<i>Gloss.</i> iv. p. 769.) Accordingly,
we are told, the word "<i>minister</i>" is sometimes used "pro <i>ministellus</i>"
(<i>Ibid.</i>), and an instance is produced which I shall insert at
large in the next paragraph.
</p>
<p>
Minstrels sometimes assisted at divine service, as appears from
the record of the ninth of Edw. IV. quoted above in p. <a href="#Page_371">371</a> by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>Haliday and others are erected into a perpetual Gild, &amp;c. See the
original in <i>Rymer</i>, xi. 642. By part of this record it is recited to
be their duty to pray (<i>exorare</i>: which it is presumed they did by
assisting in the chant, and musical accompaniment, &amp;c.) The
same also appears from the passage in the Supplem. to Du Cange,
alluded to above. "Minister ... pro <i>Ministellus</i> Joculator<a name="FNanchor_1104_1149" id="FNanchor_1104_1149"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104_1149" class="fnanchor">[1104]</a>&mdash;Vetus
ceremoniale MS. B. M. deaurat&aelig; Tolos. Item, etiam congregabuntur
Piscatores, qui debent interesse isto die in processione
cum <i>Ministris</i> seu Joculatoribus: quia ipsi Piscatores tenentur
habere isto die <i>Joculatores</i>, seu <i>Mimos</i> ob <i>honorem Crucis</i>&mdash;et
vadunt primi ante processionem cum <i>Ministris</i> seu Joculatoribus
semper pulsantibus usque ad ecclesiam S. Stephani" (<i>Gloss</i>. 773).
This may perhaps account for the clerical appearance of the
minstrels, who seem to have been distinguished by the tonsure,
which was one of the inferior marks of the clerical character.<a name="FNanchor_1105_1150" id="FNanchor_1105_1150"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105_1150" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a>
Thus Jeffery of Monmouth, speaking of one who acted the part of
a minstrel, says, <i>Rasit capillos suos &amp; barbam</i> (see note <a href="#Footnote_K_1112" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>).
Again, a writer in the reign of Elizabeth, describing the habit of
an ancient minstrel, speaks of his head as "rounded tonster-wise"
(which I venture to read tonsure-wise), "his beard smugly
shaven." See above, p. <a href="#Page_375">375</a>.
</p>
<p>
It must, however, be observed, that notwithstanding such
clerical appearance of the minstrels, and though they might be
sometimes countenanced by such of the clergy as were of more
relaxed morals, their sportive talents rendered them generally obnoxious
to the more rigid ecclesiastics, and to such of the religious
orders as were of more severe discipline; whose writings commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>abound with heavy complaints of the great encouragement shewn
to those men by the princes and nobles, and who can seldom
afford them a better name than that of <i>scurr&aelig;, famelici, nebulones</i>,
&amp;c. of which innumerable instances may be seen in Du Cange. It
was even an established order in some of the monasteries, that no
minstrel should ever be suffered to enter their gates.<a name="FNanchor_1106_1151" id="FNanchor_1106_1151"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106_1151" class="fnanchor">[1106]</a>
</p>
<p>
We have, however, innumerable particulars of the good cheer
and great rewards given to the minstrels in many of the convents,
which are collected by T. Warton (i. 91, &amp;c.) and others. But
one instance, quoted from Wood's <i>Hist. Antiq. Univ. Ox.</i> i. 67.
(Sub. An. 1224) deserves particular mention. Two itinerant
priests, on a supposition of their being <i>mimi</i> or <i>minstrels</i>, gained
admittance. But the cellarer, sacrist, and others of the brethren,
who had hoped to have been entertained with their diverting arts,
&amp;c. when they found them to be only two indigent ecclesiastics,
who could only administer spiritual consolation, and were consequently
disappointed of their mirth, beat them and turned them
out of the monastery. (<i>Ibid.</i> p. <a href="#Page_92">92</a>.) This passage furnishes an additional
proof that a minstrel might by his dress or appearance be
mistaken for an ecclesiastic.</p><br /></div>


<div class="footnoten">

<p><a name="Footnote_B_1104" id="Footnote_B_1104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_1104"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> [<i>The minstrels use mimicry and action, and other means</i>
<i>of diverting, &amp;c.</i>] It is observable that our old monkish historians
do not use the words <i>cantator</i>, <i>cithar&aelig;dus</i>, <i>musicus</i>, or the like,
to express a minstrel in Latin, so frequently as <i>mimus</i>, <i>histrio</i>,
<i>joculator</i>, or some other word that implies gesture. Hence it
might be inferred that the minstrels set off their songs with all the
arts of gesticulation, &amp;c. or according to the ingenious hypothesis
of Dr. Brown, united the powers of melody, poem, and dance.
(See his <i>History of the Rise of Poetry</i>, &amp;c.)
</p>
<p>
But indeed all the old writers describe them as exercising
various arts of this kind. Joinville, in his <i>Life of S. Lewis</i>, speaks
of some Armenian minstrels, who were very dextrous tumblers and
posture masters. "Avec le Prince vinrent trois Menestriers de la
Grande Hyermenie (Armenia) ... et avoient trois cors&mdash;Quand
ils encommenceoient a corner, vous dissiez que ce sont les voix
de cygnes, ... et fesoient les plus douces melodies.&mdash;Ils
fesoient trois merveilleus <i>saus</i>, car on leur metoit une touaille desous
les piez, et tournoient tout debout ... Les deux tournoients
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>les testes arieres," &amp;c. (See the extract at large, in the Hon. D.
Barrington's <i>Observations on the Anc. Statutes</i>, 4to. 2nd edit. p. 273, omitted in the last impression.)
</p>
<p>
This may also account for that remarkable clause in the press
warrant of Henry VI. "<i>De Ministrallis propter solatium regis providendis</i>,"
by which it is required, that the boys, to be provided <i>in</i>
<i>arte Ministrallat&ucirc;s instructos</i>, should also be <i>membris naturalibus</i>
<i>elegantes</i>. See above, p. <a href="#Page_370">370</a>. (<i>Observ. on the Anc. Stat.</i> 4th edit. p. 337.)
</p>
<p>
Although by minstrel was properly understood, in English, one
who sang to the harp, or some other instrument of music, verses
composed by himself or others; yet the term was also applied by
our old writers to such as professed either music or singing separately,
and perhaps to such as practised any of the sportive arts
connected with these.<a name="FNanchor_1107_1152" id="FNanchor_1107_1152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107_1152" class="fnanchor">[1107]</a> Music, however, being the leading idea,
was at length peculiarly called minstrelsy, and the name of minstrel
at last confined to the musician only.
</p>
<p>
In the French language all these arts were included under the
general name of <i>menestraudie</i>, <i>menestraudise</i>, <i>jonglerie</i>, &amp;c. (Med.
Lat. <i>menestellorum ars</i>, <i>ars joculatoria</i>, &amp;c.) "On peut comprendre
sous le nom de jonglerie tout ce qui appartient aux anciens
chansonniers Proven&ccedil;aux, Normands, Picards, &amp;c. Le corps de
la jonglerie etoit form&eacute; des <i>trouveres</i>, ou <i>troubadours</i>, qui composoient
les chansons, et parmi lesquels il y avoit des <i>improvisateurs</i>,
comme on en trouve en Italie; des <i>chanteurs</i> ou <i>chanteres</i> qui
executoient ou chantoient ces compositions; des <i>conteurs</i> qui
faisoient en vers ou en prose les contes, les recits, les histoires;
des <i>jongleurs</i> ou <i>menestrels</i> qui accompagnoient de leurs
instrumens,&mdash;L'art de ces chantres ou chansonniers, etoit nomm&eacute; la
Science Gaie, <i>Gay Saber</i>." (Pref. <i>Anthologie Fran&ccedil;.</i> 1765, 8vo. p.
17.) See also the curious Fauchet (<i>De l'Orig. de la Lang. Fr.</i>
p. 72, &amp;c.) "Bien tost apr&egrave;s la division de ce grand empire
Fran&ccedil;ois en tant de petits royaumes, duchez, &amp; comtez, au lieu
des Poetes commencerent a se faire cognoistre les <i>trouverres</i>, et
<i>chanterres</i>, <i>cont&euml;ours</i>, et <i>jugl&euml;ours</i>: qui sont trouveurs, chantres,
conteurs, jongleurs, ou jugleurs, c'est &agrave; dire, menestriers chantans
avec la viole."
</p>
<p>
We see then that <i>jongleur</i>, <i>jugleur</i>, (Lat. <i>joculator</i>, <i>juglator</i>) was
a peculiar name appropriated to the minstrels. "Les jongleurs
ne faisoient que chanter les poesies sur leurs instrumens. On les
appelloit aussi Menestrels," says Fontenelle, in his <i>Hist. du Theat.</i>
<i>Franc.</i> prefixed to his <i>Life of Corneille</i>.</p><br /></div>

many respects bore a strong resemblance both to the British bards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>and to the Danish scalds, appears from this, that the old monkish
writers express them all without distinction by the same names in
Latin. Thus Geoffrey of Monmouth, himself a Welshman, speaking
of an old pagan British King, who excelled in singing and
music so far as to be esteemed by his countrymen the patron deity
of the bards, uses the phrase <i>Deus</i> Joculatorum; which is the peculiar
name given to the English and French minstrels.<a name="FNanchor_1108_1153" id="FNanchor_1108_1153"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108_1153" class="fnanchor">[1108]</a> In like
manner, William Malmesbury, speaking of a Danish king's assuming
the profession of a scald, expresses it by <i>professus</i> mimum;

Indeed, Du Cange, in his <i>Glossary</i>, quotes a writer who positively
asserts that the minstrels of the middle ages were the same with the
ancient bards. I shall give a large extract from this learned glossographer,
as he relates many curious particulars concerning the profession
and arts of the minstrels; whom, after the monks, he stigmatizes
by the name of <i>scurr&aelig;</i>; though he acknowledges their
songs often tended to inspire virtue.

The rest may be seen in Du Cange, who thus proceeds, "Mitto
reliqua similia, ex quibus omnino patet ejusmodi mimorum &amp;
ministellorum cantilenas ad virtutem principes excitasse....
Id pr&aelig;sertim in pugn&aelig; pr&aelig;cinctu, dominis suis occinebant, ut
martium ardorem in eorum animis concitarent: cujusmodi cantum

lib. 4. de Mirac. S. Bened. c. 37. Tanta vero illis securitas ...
ut scurram se precedere facerent, qui musico instrumento res
fortiter gestas et priorum bella pr&aelig;cineret, quatenus his acrius
incitarentur, &amp;c." As the writer was a monk, we shall not wonder
at his calling the minstrel, <i>scurram</i>.
</p>
<p>
This word <i>scurra</i>, or some one similar, is represented in the
Glossaries as the proper meaning of <i>leccator</i> (Fr. <i>leccour</i>) the ancient
term by which the <i>minstrel</i> appears to be expressed in the
Grant to Dutton, quoted above in page <a href="#Page_363">363</a>. On this head I shall
produce a very curious passage, which is twice quoted in Du
Cange's <i>Glossary</i>. (Sc. ad verb. Menestellus &amp; ad verb. Lecator.)
"Philippus Mouskes in Philip. Aug. fingit Carolum M. Provincie
comitatum scurris &amp; mimis suis olim donasse, indeque postea

The word scald comprehended both characters among the
Danes, nor do I know that they had any peculiar name for either
of them separate. But it was not so with the Anglo-Saxons. They
called a poet Sceop. and Leo&eth;&thorn;y&#775;&#42883;&#42887;a: the last of these comes from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
Leo&eth;, a song; and the former answers to our old word make
(Gr. &Pi;&omicron;&iota;&eta;&tau;&#x1F75;&sigmaf;), being derived from Sc&iota;ppan or Sceopan, <i>formare</i>,
<i>facere</i>, <i>fingere</i>, <i>creare</i> (Ang. to shape). As for the minstrel, they
distinguished him by the peculiar appellation of Gl&iota;&#7545;man, and perhaps
by the more simple title of &ETH;ea&#42883;pe&#42883;e, harper: (See below,
notes <a href="#Footnote_H_1110" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>, <a href="#Footnote_I_1111" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>.) This last title, at least, is often given to a minstrel by
our most ancient English rhymists. See in this work vol. i. book i.

Cange affirms, that in the middle ages the courts of princes
swarmed so much with this kind of men, and such large sums were expended
in maintaining and rewarding them, that they often drained
the royal treasures: especially, he adds, of such as were delighted
with their flatteries (<i>pr&aelig;sertim qui ejusmodi ministellorum assentationibus</i>
<i>delectabantur</i>). He then confirms his assertion by several passages
out of monastic writers, who sharply inveigh against this
extravagance. Of these I shall here select only one or two, which
show what kind of rewards were bestowed on these old songsters.
</p>
<p>
"Rigordus de Gestis Philippi Aug. an. 1185. 'Cum in curiis
regum seu aliorum principum, frequens turba histrionum convenire

excogitatas, et variis florum picturationibus artificios&egrave; elaboratas,
pro quibus forsan 20 vel. 30 marcas argenti consumpserant, vix revolutis septem diebus, histrionibus, ministris diaboli, ad primam
vocem dedisse, &amp;c."
</p>
<p>
The curious reader may find a similar, though at the same time
a more candid account, in that most excellent writer, Presid.
Fauchet (<i>Recueil de la Lang. Fr.</i> p. 73), who says, that, like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>ancient Greek &Alpha;&omicron;&iota;&delta;&omicron;&iota;, "Nos trouverres, ainsi que ceux la, prenans
leur subject sur les faits des vaillans (qu'ils appelloyent geste,
venant de <i>gesta</i> Latin) alloyent ... par les cours rejouir les
princes ... Remportans des grandes recompences des seigneurs,
qui bien souvent leur donnoyent jusques aux robes qu'ils avoyent
vestues: &amp; lesquelles ces jugl&euml;ours ne failloyent de porter aux
autres cours, &agrave; fin d'inviter les seigneurs a pareille liberalit&eacute;. Ce
qui a dur&eacute; si longuement, qu'il me souvient avoir veu Martin
Baraton (ja viel menestrier d'Orleans) lequel aux festes et nopces
batoit un tabourin d'argent, sem&eacute; des plaques aussi d'argent gravees
des armoiries de ceux a qui il avoit appris a danser." Here we see
that a minstrel sometimes performed the function of a dancing-master.
</p>
<p>
Fontenelle even gives us to understand, that these men were
often rewarded with favours of a still higher kind. "Les princesses
&amp; les plus grandes dames y joignoient souvent leurs faveurs.
Elles etoient fort foibles contre les beaux esprits." (<i>Hist. du Th&eacute;at.</i>)
We are not to wonder then that this profession should be followed
by men of the first quality, particularly the younger sons and
brothers of great houses. "Tel qui par les partages de sa famille
n'avoit que la moiti&eacute; ou le quart d'une vieux chateaux bien seigneurial,
alloit quelque temps courir le monde en rimant, et revenoit
acquerir le reste de Chateau." (<i>Fontenelle, Hist. du Th&eacute;at.</i>) We
see then, that there was no improbable fiction in those ancient
songs and romances, which are founded on the story of minstrels
being beloved by kings' daughters, &amp;c., and discovering themselves
to be the sons of some sovereign prince, &amp;c.</p><br /></div>


<div class="footnoten">

<p><a name="Footnote_F_1108" id="Footnote_F_1108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_1108"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> The honours and rewards lavished upon the minstrels were
not confined to the continent. Our own countryman Johannes
Sarisburiensis (in the time of Henry II.) declaims no less than the
monks abroad, against the extravagant favour shown to these men.
Non enim more nugatorum ejus seculi in histriones &amp; mimos, et
hujusmodi monstra hominum, ob fam&aelig; redemptionem &amp; dilatationem
nominis effunditis opes vestras, &amp;c. (<i>Epist.</i> 247.<a name="FNanchor_1111_1156" id="FNanchor_1111_1156"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111_1156" class="fnanchor">[1111]</a>)

<p>
The monks seem to grudge every act of munificence that was
not applied to the benefit of themselves and their convents. They
therefore bestow great applauses upon the Emperor Henry, who,
at his marriage with Agnes of Poictou, in 1044, disappointed the
poor minstrels, and sent them away empty. "Infinitam histrionum
&amp; joculatorum multitudinem sine cibo &amp; muneribus vacuam
&amp; m&oelig;rentem abire permisit." (<i>Chronic. Virtziburg.</i>) For which
I doubt not but he was sufficiently stigmatized in the songs and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>ballads of those times. Vid. Du Cange, <i>Gloss.</i> tom. iv. p

Of the few histories now remaining that were written before
the Norman Conquest, almost all are such short and naked
sketches and abridgements, giving only a concise and general relation
of the more remarkable events, that scarce any of the minute
circumstantial particulars are to be found in them: nor do they
hardly ever descend to a description of the customs, manners, or
domestic economy of their countrymen. The <i>Saxon Chronicle</i>, for
instance, which is the best of them, and upon some accounts extremely
valuable, is almost such an epitome as Lucius Florus and
Eutropius have left us of the Roman history. As for Ethelward,
his book is judged to be an imperfect translation of the <i>Saxon</i>
<i>Chronicle</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1112_1157" id="FNanchor_1112_1157"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112_1157" class="fnanchor">[1112]</a> and the <i>Pseudo Asser</i>, or <i>Chronicle of St. Neot</i>, is a
poor defective performance. How absurd would it be then to
argue against the existence of customs or facts, from the silence of
such scanty records as these! Whoever would carry his researches
deep into that period of history, might safely plead the excuse of a
learned writer, who had particularly studied the Ante-Norman historians.

the common musical instrument of the Anglo-Saxons, might be inferred
from the very word itself, which is not derived from the
British, or any other Celtic language, but of genuine Gothic original,
and current among every branch of that people: viz. Ang.-Sax.
&ETH;ea&#42883;pe, &ETH;ea&#42883;pa; Iceland. harpa, haurpa; Dan. and Belg.
harpe; Germ, harpffe, harpffa; Gal. harpe; Span. harpa; Ital.
arpa. (Vid. <i>Jun. Etym., Menage Etym.</i> &amp;c.) As also from this, that
the word &ETH;ea&#42883;pe is constantly used, in the Anglo-Saxon versions,
to express the Latin words <i>cithara</i>, <i>lyra</i>, and even <i>cymbalum</i>: the
word <i>psalmus</i> itself being sometimes translated &ETH;ea&#42883;p &#42885;an&#7545;, harp
song (<i>Gloss, Jun. R. apud Lye Anglo-Sax. Lexic.</i>)
</p>
<p>
But the fact itself is positively proved by the express testimony
of Bede, who tells us that it was usual at festival meetings for this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>instrument to be handed round, and each of the company to sing
to it in his turn. See his <i>Hist. Eccles. Anglor.</i> lib. iv. c. 24, where
speaking of their sacred poet C&aelig;dmon, who lived in the times of
the Heptarchy (<i>ob. circ.</i> 680) he says:
</p>
<p>
"Nihil unquam frivoli &amp; supervacui poematis facere potuit;
sed ea tantummodo, qu&aelig; ad religionem pertinent, religiosam ejus
linguam decebant. Siquidem in habitu s&aelig;culari, usque ad tempora
provectioris &aelig;tatis constitutus, nil carminum aliquando didicerat.
Unde nonnunquam in convivio, cum esset l&aelig;titia causa ut omnes
per ordinem cantare deberent, ille ubi appropinquare sibi citharam
cernebat, surgebat a medi&acirc; c&oelig;n&acirc;, et egressus ad suam domum
repedabat."

In this version of Alfred's it is observable, (1) that he has expressed
the Latin word <i>cantare</i>, by the Anglo-Saxon words "be hea&#42883;pan &#42885;&iota;n&#7545;an," sing to the harp; as if they were synonymous, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
as if his countrymen had no idea of singing unaccompanied with
the harp: (2) That when Bede simply says, <i>surgebat a medi&acirc; c&oelig;n&acirc;</i>,
he assigns a motive, "a&#42883;a&#42885; &#42876;o&#42883; &#42885;ceome," arose for shame: that
is, either from an austerity of manners, or from his being deficient
in an accomplishment which so generally prevailed among his
countrymen.</p><br /></div>

This word glee is derived from the Anglo-Saxon Gl&iota;&#7545;&#7545;, (Gligg)
<i>musica</i>, music, minstrelsy (Somn). This is the common radix,
whence arises such a variety of terms and phrases relating to the
minstrel art, as affords the strongest internal proof, that this profession
was extremely common and popular here before the Norman
Conquest. Thus we have
</p>
<p class="center">I.</p>
<p>
(1) Gl&iota;p (Gliw.), <i>mimus</i>, a minstrel.
Gl&iota;&#7545;man, &#7545;l&iota;&#7545;mon, &#7545;l&iota;man, (gleeman<a name="FNanchor_1113_1158" id="FNanchor_1113_1158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113_1158" class="fnanchor">[1113]</a>) <i>histrio</i>, <i>mimus</i>, <i>pantomimus</i>;
all common names in middle latinity for a minstrel; and
Somner accordingly renders the original by a minstrel&mdash;a player
on a timbrel or taber. He adds, a fidler; but although the <i>fythel</i>
or <i>fiddle</i>, was an ancient instrument, by which the <i>jogelar</i> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
minstrel sometimes accompanied his song (see Warton, i. 17), it is
probable that Somner annexes here only a modern sense to the
word, not having at all investigated the subject.
</p>
<p>
Gl&iota;&iota;men, &#7545;l&iota;&iota;&#7545;men, (Gleemen), <i>histriones</i>, minstrels. Hence,
</p>
<p>
Gli&#7545;manna-y&#775;ppe. <i>Orchestra</i>, vel <i>pulpitus</i>. The place where
the minstrels exhibited their performances.
</p>
<p>
(2) But their most proper and expressive name was
</p>
<p>
Gl&iota;phleo&thorn;&#42883;&iota;en&#42874;, <i>musicus</i>, a minstrel; and
</p>
<p>
Gl&iota;phleo&thorn;&#42883;&iota;en&#42874;l&iota;ca, <i>musicus</i>, musical.
</p>
<p>
These two words include the full idea of the minstrel character,
expressing at once their music and singing, being compounded of
Gl&iota;p, <i>musicus, mimus</i>, a musician, minstrel; and Leo&eth;, <i>carmen</i>,
a song.
</p>
<p>
(3) From the above word Gl&iota;&#7545;&#7545;, the profession itself was called.
</p>
<p>
Gl&iota;&#7545;c&#42883;&aelig;&#42876;&#42887; (glig <i>or</i> glee-craft), <i>musica, histrionia, mimica</i>
<i>gesticulatio</i>: which Somner rightly gives in English, ministrelsy,
mimical gesticulation, mummery. He also adds stage-playing:
but here again I think he substitutes an idea too modern, induced
by the word <i>histrionia</i>, which in middle latinity only signifies the
minstrel-art.
</p>
<p>
However, it should seem that both mimical gesticulation and a
kind of rude exhibition of characters were sometimes attempted by
the old minstrels: but
</p>
<p>
(4) As musical performance was the leading idea, so
</p>
<p>
Gl&iota;op&iota;an, is <i>Cantus musicos edere</i>; and
</p>
<p>
Gl&iota;&#7545;beam, &#7545;l&iota;pbeam (glig or glee-beam), <i>tympanum</i>; a timbrel
or taber. (So Somn.) Hence
</p>
<p>
Gly&#775;pan. <i>Tympanum pulsare</i>; and
</p>
<p>
Gl&iota;p-me&#7545;en; &#7545;l&iota;y&#775;p&iota;en&#42874;e-ma&#42874;en; (glee-maiden), <i>tympanistria</i>:
which Somner renders a she-minstrel; for it should seem that they
had females of this profession; one name for which was also
Gly&#775;pby&#775;&#42874;ene&#42885;&#42887;&#42883;a.
</p>
<p>
(5) Of congenial derivation to the foregoing is
</p>
<p>
Gly&#775;pc. (Glywc), <i>Tibia</i>, a pipe or flute.
</p>
<p>
Both this and the common radix Gl&iota;&#7545;&#7545; are with great appearance
of truth derived by Junius from the Icelandic Gliggur, <i>flatus</i>;
as supposing that the first attempts at music among our Gothic ancestors
were with wind-instruments. Vid. <i>Jun. Etym. Ang.</i> v. Glee.
</p>
<p class="center">II.</p>
<p>
But the minstrels, as is hinted above, did not confine themselves
to the mere exercise of their primary arts of music and song, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
occasionally used many other modes of diverting. Hence, from the
above root was derived, in a secondary sense:
</p>
<p>
(1) Gleo, and p&iota;n&#42885;um gl&iota;p, <i>faceti&aelig;</i>.
</p>
<p>
Gleop&iota;an, <i>jocari</i>; to jest, or, be merry (Somn.), and
</p>
<p>
Gleop&iota;en&#42874;, <i>jocans</i>; jesting, speaking merrily. (Somn.)
</p>
<p>
Gl&iota;&#7545;man, also signified <i>jocista</i>, a jester.
</p>
<p>
Gl&iota;&#7545;-&#7545;amen, (glee-games), <i>joci</i>. Which Somner renders, merriments,
or merry jests, or tricks, or sports, gamboles.
</p>
<p>
(2) Hence, again, by a common metonymy of the cause for the
effect:

<p>
Gl&iota;e, <i>gaudium</i>, <i>alacritas</i>, <i>l&aelig;titia</i>, <i>faceti&aelig;</i>; joy, mirth, gladness,
cheerfulness, glee. (Somner.) Which last application of the word
still continues, though rather in a low debasing sense.
</p>

<p>
But however agreeable and delightful the various arts of the
minstrels might be to the Anglo-Saxon laity, there is reason to believe,
that before the Norman Conquest, at least, they were not
much favoured by the clergy; particularly by those of monastic
profession. For, not to mention that the sportive talents of these
men would be considered by those austere ecclesiastics, as tending
to levity and licentiousness, the pagan origin of their art would
excite in the monks an insuperable prejudice against it. The
Anglo-Saxon harpers and gleemen were the immediate successors
and imitators of the Scandinavian scalds, who were the great
promoters of Pagan superstition, and fomented that spirit of
cruelty and outrage in their countrymen the Danes, which fell
with such peculiar severity on the religious and their convents.
Hence arose a third application of words derived from Gl&iota;&#7545;&#7545;,
minstrelsy, in a very unfavourable sense, and this chiefly prevails
in books of religion and ecclesiastic discipline. Thus:
</p>
<p>
(1) Gl&iota;g is <i>ludibrium</i>, laughing to scorn.<a name="FNanchor_1114_1159" id="FNanchor_1114_1159"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114_1159" class="fnanchor">[1114]</a> So in S. Basil.

<i>ludibrio habebant salutarem ejus admonitionm</i>. (10.) This sense of
the word was perhaps not ill-founded, for as the sport of rude uncultivated
minds often arises from ridicule, it is not improbable but
the old minstrels often indulged a vein of this sort, and that of no
very delicate kind. So again,
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>
<p>
Gl&iota;&#7545;-man was also used to signify <i>scurra</i>, a saucy jester (Somn.)

</p>
<p>
(2) Again, as the various attempts to please, practised by an
order of men who owed their support to the public favour, might
be considered by those grave censors, as mean and debasing:
Hence came from the same root,
</p>
<p>
Gl&iota;pe&#42883;. <i>Parasitus, assentator</i>; a fawner, a togger, a parasite, a
flatterer.<a name="FNanchor_1115_1160" id="FNanchor_1115_1160"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115_1160" class="fnanchor">[1115]</a> (Somn.)

<p>
To return to the Anglo-Saxon word Gl&iota;&#7545;&#7545;: notwithstanding
the various secondary senses in which this word (as we have seen
above) was so early applied; yet
</p>
<p>
The derivative <i>glee</i> (though now chiefly used to express merriment
and joy) long retained its first simple meaning, and is even applied
by Chaucer to signify music and minstrelsy. (Vid. Jun. Etym.)
E.g.
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For though that the best harper upon live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would on the best sounid jolly harpe<br /></span>

<span class="i4">It shoulde makin every wight to dull<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To heare is <i>glee</i>, and of his strokes full."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p class="right"><i>Troyl. L.</i> ii.</p>
<p>
Junius interprets <i>glees</i> by <i>musica instrumenta</i>, in the following
passages of Chaucer's third boke of Fame:&mdash;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... Stoden ... the castell all aboutin<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And other harpers many one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Briton Glaskyrion."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
After mentioning these, the great masters of the art, he proceeds:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And small harpers with her <i>glees</i><br /></span>

</div></div>
<p>
Again, a little below, the poet having enumerated the performers
on all the different sorts of instruments, adds:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There sawe I syt in other sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Playing upon other sundry <i>glees</i>,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">More than starres ben in heven," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Upon the above lines I shall only make a few observations:
</p>
<p>
(1) That by jestours, I suppose we are to understand gestours;
scil. the relaters of gests (Lat. <i>gesta</i>) or stories of adventures both
comic and tragical; whether true or feigned; I am inclined to add,
whether in prose or verse. (Compare the record below, in marginal
note, subjoined to v. 2.) Of the stories in prose, I conceive we
have specimens in that singular book the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>, and
this will account for its seemingly improper title. These were
evidently what the French called <i>conteours</i>, or story-tellers, and to
them we are probably indebted for the first prose romances of
chivalry, which may be considered as specimens of their manner.
</p>
<p>
(2) That the "Briton Glaskeryon," whoever he was, is apparently
the same person with our famous harper Glasgerion, of whom the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>reader will find a tragical ballad, in vol. iii. book 1, No. 7. In
that song may be seen an instance of what was advanced above in
note <a href="#Footnote_E_1107" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> of the dignity of the minstrel profession, or at least of
the artifice with which the minstrels endeavoured to set off its importance.
</p>
<p>
Thus "a king's son is represented as appearing in the character
of a harper or minstrel in the court of another king. He wears a
collar (or gold chain) as a person of illustrious rank; rides on
horseback, and is admitted to the embraces of a king's daughter."
</p>
<p>
The minstrels lost no opportunity of doing honour to their art.
</p>
<p>
(3) As for the word <i>glees</i>, it is to this day used in a musical
sense, and applied to a peculiar piece of composition. Who has
not seen the advertisements, proposing a reward to him who should
produce the best catch, canon, or glee?</p><br /></div>

own words are: "Cum ergo alterius modi aditum [Baldulphus]

precisely a minstrel, appears not only from this passage, where it
is used as a word of like import to <i>citharista</i> or harper (which was
the old English word for minstrel), but also from another passage
of the same author, where it is applied as equivalent to <i>cantor</i>.
See lib. i. cap. 22, where, speaking of an ancient (perhaps fabulous)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>British king, he says: "Hic omnes cantores quos pr&aelig;cedens &aelig;tas

<p><a name="Footnote_L_1113" id="Footnote_L_1113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_L_1113"><span class="label">[L]</span></a> [<i>Two remarkable facts.</i>] Both these facts are recorded
by William of Malmesbury; and the first of them, relating to
Alfred, by Ingulphus also. Now Ingulphus (afterwards abbot of
Croyland) was near forty years of age at the time of the Conquest,<a name="FNanchor_1118_1163" id="FNanchor_1118_1163"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118_1163" class="fnanchor">[1118]</a>
and consequently was as proper a judge of the Saxon manners, as
if he had actually written his history before that event: he is therefore
to be considered as an Anti-Norman writer; so that whether
the fact concerning Alfred be true or not, we are assured from his
testimony, that the <i>joculator</i> or minstrel was a common character
among the Anglo-Saxons. The same also may be inferred from the
relation of William of Malmesbury, who outlived Ingulphus but
thirty-three years.<a name="FNanchor_1119_1164" id="FNanchor_1119_1164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119_1164" class="fnanchor">[1119]</a> Both these writers had doubtless recourse to
innumerable records and authentic memorials of the Anglo-Saxon
times, which never descended down to us; their testimony therefore
is too positive and full to be overturned by the mere silence
of the two or three slight Anglo-Saxon epitomes, that are now
remaining (vid. note <a href="#Footnote_G_1109" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>).
</p>
<p>
As for Asser Menevensis, who has given a somewhat more particular
detail of Alfred's actions, and yet takes no notice of the following
story; it will not be difficult to account for his silence, if
we consider that he was a rigid monk, and that the minstrels, however
acceptable to the laity, were never much respected by men of
the more strict monastic profession, especially before the Norman
Conquest, when they would be considered as brethren of the Pagan
scalds.<a name="FNanchor_1120_1165" id="FNanchor_1120_1165"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120_1165" class="fnanchor">[1120]</a> Asser therefore might not regard Alfred's skill in minstrelsy in a very favourable light; and might be induced to drop
the circumstance related below, as reflecting in his opinion no
great honour on his patron.
</p>
<p>
The learned editor of Alfred's life in Latin, after having examined
the scene of action in person, and weighed all the circumstances
of the event, determines from the whole collective evidence,
that Alfred could never have gained the victory he did, if he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>not with his own eyes previously seen the disposition of the enemy
by such a stratagem as is here described. Vid. <i>Annot. in &AElig;lfr.</i>

</p>
<p>
Malmesbury adds, <i>Unius tantum fidelissimi fruebatur conscietiti&acirc;</i>.
As this confidant does not appear to have assumed the disguise of
a minstrel himself, I conclude that he only appeared as the minstrel's
attendant. Now that the minstrel had sometimes his servant or
attendant to carry his harp, and even to sing to his music, we
have many instances in the old metrical romances, and even some
in this present collection. See vol. i. song vi., vol. iii. song vii.,
&amp;c. Among the French and Proven&ccedil;al bards, the <i>trouverre</i>, or
inventor, was generally attended with his singer, who sometimes
also played on the harp, or other musical instrument. "Quelque
fois durant le repas d'un prince on voyoit arriver un trouverre
inconnu avec ses menestrels ou jongleours, et il leur faisoit chanter
sur leurs harpes ou vielles les vers qu'il avoit compos&eacute;s. Ceux
qui faisoient les sons <i>aussi</i> bien qui les <i>mots</i> etoient les plus
estim&eacute;s." <i>Fontenelle, Hist, du Theatr.</i>
</p>
<p>
That Alfred excelled in music is positively asserted by Bale,
who doubtless had it from some ancient MS. many of which subsisted
in his time, that are now lost; as also by Sir J. Spelman,
who we may conclude had good authority for this anecdote, as he
is known to have compiled his life of Alfred from authentic materials
collected by his learned father; this writer informs us that
Alfred "provided himself of musitians, not common, or such as
knew but the practick part, but men skilful in the art itself, whose
skill and service he yet further improved with his own instruction."
p. 199. This proves Alfred at least to have understood the theory
of music; and how could this have been acquired without practising
on some instrument? Which, we have seen above, note <a href="#Footnote_H_1110" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>,
was so extremely common with the Anglo-Saxons, even in much
ruder times, that Alfred himself plainly tells us, it was <i>shameful</i> to
be ignorant of it. And this commonness might be one reason,
why Asser did not think it of consequence enough to be particularly
mentioned in his short life of that great monarch. This rigid
monk may also have esteemed it a slight and frivolous accomplishment
savouring only of worldly vanity. He has however particularly
recorded Alfred's fondness for the oral Anglo-Saxon poems and
songs. (<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span><i>Saxonica poemata die nocteque ... audiens ... memoriter</i>

That <i>joculator</i> is properly a minstrel might be inferred from the
two foregoing passages of Geoffery of Monmouth (v. Note <a href="#Footnote_K_1112" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>),
where the word is used as equivalent to <i>citharista</i> in one place,
and to <i>cantor</i> in the other: this union forms the precise idea of
the character.

<p>
As the minstrel was termed in French <i>jongleur</i> and <i>jugleur</i>;
so he was called in Spanish <i>jutglar</i> and <i>juglar</i>. "Tenemos canciones
y versos para recitar muy antiguos y memorias ciertas de los
Juglares, que assistian en los banquetes, como los que pinta

In England the king's juglar continued to have an establishment

<i>to exist.</i>] Of this we have proof positive in the old metrical
romance of <i>Horn-Child</i>, (vol. iii. appendix), which, although
from the mention of Sarazens, &amp;c. it must have been written at
least after the first Crusade in 1096, yet from its Anglo-Saxon language
or idiom, can scarce be dated later than within a century
after the Conquest. This, as appears from its very exordium, was
intended to be sung to a popular audience, whether it was composed
by, or for, a gleeman, or minstrel. But it carries all the internal
marks of being the production of such a composer. It appears
of genuine English growth, for after a careful examination, I cannot
discover any allusion to French or Norman customs, manners, composition
or phraseology: no quotation "As the Romance sayth:"
not a name or local reference which was likely to occur to a French
rimeur. The proper names are all of northern extraction. Child
Horn is the son of Allof (<i>i.e.</i> Olaf or Olave), king of Sudenne (I
suppose Sweden), by his queen Godylde, or Godylt. Athulf and
Fykenyld are the names of subjects. Eylmer or Aylmere is king
of Westnesse (a part of Ireland), Rymenyld is his daughter; as
Erminyld is of another king Thurstan; whose sons are Athyld and
Beryld. Athelbrus is steward of K. Aylmer, &amp;c. &amp;c. All these
savour only of a northern origin, and the whole piece is exactly
such a performance as one would expect from a gleeman or minstrel
of the north of England, who had derived his art and his ideas
from his scaldic predecessors there. So that this probably is the
original, from which was translated the old French fragment of
<i>Dan Horn</i>, in the Harleyan MS. 527, mentioned by Tyrwhitt
(Chaucer iv. 68), and by T. Warton (Hist. i. 38), whose extract
from <i>Horn-Child</i> is extremely incorrect.
</p>
<p>
Compare the stile of Child-Horn with the Anglo-Saxon specimens
in short verses and rhime, which are assigned to the century succeeding
the Conquest, in Hickes's <i>Thesaurus</i>, tom. i. cap. 24, pp.
224 and 231.</p><br /></div>

<i>rambling minstrel.</i>] Among the old metrical romances, a very
few are addressed to readers, or mention reading: these appear to
have been composed by writers at their desk, and exhibit marks of
more elaborate structure and invention. Such is <i>Eglamour of Artas</i>
(No. 20, vol. iii. appendix), of which I find in a MS. copy in the
Cotton Library, A. 2, folio 3, the II. Fitte thus concludes:

divisions (Sign. E. ii. b. in pr. copy) ends thus:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let hym go, God him spede<br /></span>

<p>

we have
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In Geste as we rede,"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
and similar phrases occur in stanzas 34, 125, 140, 196, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
These are all studied compositions, in which the story is invented
with more skill and ingenuity, and the style and colouring are of
superior cast, to such as can with sufficient probability be attributed
to the minstrels themselves.
</p>
<p>
Of this class I conceive the romance of <i>Horn Child</i> (mentioned
in the last note, <a href="#Footnote_S2_1121" class="fnanchor">[S2]</a>, and in No. 1, vol. iii. appendix), which,
from the naked unadorned simplicity of the story, I would attribute
to such an origin.
</p>
<p>
But more evidently is such the <i>Squire of Lowe Degree</i> (No. 24,
iii. appendix), in which is no reference to any French original,
nothing like the phrase which so frequently occurs in others,
"As the Romance sayth,"<a name="FNanchor_1125_1170" id="FNanchor_1125_1170"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125_1170" class="fnanchor">[1125]</a> or the like. And it is just such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
rambling performance, as one would expect from an itinerant bard.
And
</p>
<p>
Such also is <i>A lytell Geste of Robyn Hode, &amp;c.</i> in eight fyttes, of
which are extant two editions, 4to. in black letter, described more
fully in this volume, book i. No. 8. This is not only of undoubted
English growth, but, from the constant satire aimed at abbots and
their convents, &amp;c. could not possibly have been composed by
any monk in his cell.
</p>
<p>
Other instances might be produced; but especially of the former
kind is <i>Syr Launfal</i> (No. 11, iii. appendix), the 121st st. of
which has
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In Romances as we rede."<br /></span>

the only one in which is inserted the name of the author.</p><br /></div>

That <i>mimus</i> is properly a minstrel in the sense affixed to the
word in this essay, one extract from the accounts (Lat. <i>computis</i>)

show, scil.: "Dat. Sex. Mimis Dni. Clynton cantantibus, citharisantibus,
ludentibus, &amp;c. iiii. s." (T. Warton, ii. 106, note q.) The

<p>
In the <i>Monasticon</i>, tom. ii. p. 166, 167, is a curious history of
the founder of this priory, and the cause of its erection: which
seems exactly such a composition as one of those which were
manufactured by Dr. Stone, the famous legend-maker, in 1380;
(see T. Warton's curious account of him, in vol. ii. p. 190, note),
who required no materials to assist him in composing his
narra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>tives, &amp;c. For in this legend are no particulars given of the
founder, but a recital of miraculous visions exciting him to this
pious work, of its having been before revealed to K. Edward the
Confessor, and predicted by three Grecians, &amp;c. Even his minstrel
profession is not mentioned, whether from ignorance or design, as
the profession was perhaps falling into discredit when this legend
was written. There is only a general indistinct account that he
frequented royal and noble houses, where he ingratiated himself
<i>suavitate joculari</i>. (This last is the only word that seems to have
any appropriated meaning.) This will account for the indistinct, incoherent
account given by Stow: "Rahere, a pleasant-witted
gentleman, and therefore in his time called the King's Minstrel."&mdash;<i>Survey</i>

Indeed, many of our old metrical romances, whether originally
English, or translated from the French to be sung to an English
audience, are addressed to persons of high rank, as appears from
their beginning thus: "Listen, Lordings," and the like. These
were prior to the time of Chaucer, as appears from vol. iii. appendix
(sect. ii.). And yet to his time our Norman nobles are supposed
to have adhered to their French language.</p><br /></div>

i. (r. ii.) p. 185, but gives it as enlarged by D. Powel, in his <i>Hist.</i>
<i>of Cambria</i>, p. 196, who is known to have followed ancient Welsh
MSS. The words in the Monasticon are: "Qui accersitis Sutoribus
Cestri&aelig; et Histrionibus, festinanter cum exercitu suo venit domino
suo facere succursum. Walenses vero videntes multitudinem magnam
venientem, relict&acirc; obsidione fugerunt.... Et propter hoc
dedit comes antedictus.... Constabulario dominationem Sutorum
et Histrionum. Constabularius vero retinuit sibi et h&aelig;redibus
suis dominationem Sutorum: et Histrionum dedit vero Seneschallo."
So the passage should apparently be pointed; but either
<i>et</i> or <i>vero</i> seems redundant.
</p>
<p>
We shall see below in note <a href="#Footnote_Z_1133" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> the proper import of the word
<i>histriones</i>; but it is very remarkable that this is not the word used
in the grant of the constable De Lacy to Dutton, but "magisterium
omnium <i>leccatorum</i> et <i>meretricium</i> totius Cestreshire, sicut liberius
illum (<i>sic</i>) magisterium teneo de comite" (<i>vid.</i> Blount's <i>Ancient Tenures</i>,
p. 156). Now, as under this grant the heirs of Dutton confessedly
held for many ages a <i>magisterial</i> jurisdiction over all
the minstrels and musicians of that county, and as it could not
be conveyed by the word <i>meretrices</i>, the natural inference is, that
the minstrels were expressed by the term <i>leccatores</i>. It is true, Du
Cange compiling his Glossary could only find in the writers he
consulted this word used in the abusive sense, often applied to
every synonyme of the sportive and dissolute minstrel, viz. <i>Scurra</i>,
<i>vaniloquus</i>, <i>parasitus</i>, <i>epulo</i>, &amp;c. (This I conceive to be the
proper arrangement of these explanations, which only express the
character given to the minstrel elsewhere: see Du Cange, <i>passim</i>,
and notes, <a href="#Footnote_C_1105" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>, <a href="#Footnote_E_1107" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>, <a href="#Footnote_F_1108" class="fnanchor">[F]</a>, <a href="#Footnote_I_1111" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>, iii. 2, &amp;c.) But he quotes an ancient MS.
in French metre, wherein the leccour (Lat. <i>leccator</i>) and the
minstrel are joined together, as receiving from Charlemagne a
grant of the territory of Provence, and from whom the Proven&ccedil;al
troubadours were derived, &amp;c. See the passage above in note <a href="#Footnote_C_1105" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>

The exception in favour of the family of Dutton is thus ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>pressed

</p>
<p>
These abuses arose again to as great a height as ever in little
more than a century after; in consequence, I suppose, of the
licentiousness that crept in during the civil wars of York and Lancaster.
This appears from the charter, 9 E. IV. referred to in p.
xlv. "Ex querulos&acirc; insinuatione ... Ministrallorum nostrorum
accepimus qualiter nonnulli rudes agricol&aelig; &amp; artifices diversarum

de ligeis nostris deceptive colligunt, &amp;c."
</p>
<p>
Abuses of this kind prevailed much later in Wales, as appears
from the famous commission issued out in 9 Eliz. (1567) for bestowing
the silver harp on the best minstrel, rythmer, or bard, in
the principality of North Wales: of which a fuller account will be
given below in note <a href="#Footnote_BB3_1138" class="fnanchor">[Bb3]</a>.</p><br /></div>

&amp;c. fol. 1633, p. 521 (Acc. of Westm. Hall). Stow had this passage
from Walsingham's <i>Hist. Ang.</i> ... "Intravit qu&aelig;dam mulier
ornata histrionali habitu, equum bonum insidens histrionaliter
phaleratum, qu&aelig; mensas more histrionum circuivit; &amp; tandem

1603, fol. p. 109.
</p>
<p>
It may be observed here, that minstrels and others often rode on
horseback up to the royal table, when the kings were feasting in
their great halls. See in this vol. book I, No. 6.
</p>
<p>
The answer of the porters (when they were afterwards blamed
for admitting her) also deserves attention. "Non esse moris domus
regi&aelig; histriones ab ingressu quomodolibet prohibere, &amp;c." Walsingh.
</p>
<p>
That Stow rightly translated the Latin word <i>histrio</i> here by
<i>minstrel</i>, meaning a musician that sung, and whose subjects were
stories of chivalry, admits of easy proof; for in the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>
chap. cxi. Mercury is represented as coming to Argus in the character
of a minstrel; when he "incepit, more <i>histrionico</i> fabulas
dicere, et plerumque cantare." (T. Warton, iii. p. li.) And
Muratori cites a passage, in an old Italian chronicle, wherein mention
is made of a stage erected at Milan: "Super quo <i>histriones</i>
<i>cantibant</i>, sicut modo cantatur de Rolando et Oliverio." <i>Antich.</i>

This may be inferred from the variety of names appropriated to
them in the Middle Ages, viz. Anglo-Sax. Gl&iota;p-me&#42874;en (Glee-maiden),
&amp;c. &#7545;ly&#775;p&iota;en&#42874;ema&#42874;en, &#7545;ly&#775;pby&#775;&#42874;ene&#42885;&#42887;&#42883;a. (vid. supra, p.

<i>ministerialis</i>, &amp;c. (vid. Du Cange, <i>Gloss. &amp; Suppl.</i>)
</p>
<p>
See what is said in p. <a href="#Page_371">371</a> concerning the "sisters of the fraternity
of minstrels;" see also a passage quoted by Dr. Burney (ii. 315)
from Muratori, of the chorus of women singing thro' the streets
accompanied with musical instruments in 1268.
</p>
<p>
Had the female described by Walsingham been a <i>tombestere</i>, or
dancing-woman (see Tyrwhitt's <i>Chaucer</i>, iv. 307, and v. Gloss.) that
historian would probably have used the word <i>saltatrix</i> (see T.
Warton, i. 240, note M.)
</p>
<p>
These <i>saltatrices</i> were prohibited from exhibiting in churches
and church-yards along with <i>joculatores</i>, <i>histriones</i>, with whom they
were sometimes classed, especially by the rigid ecclesiastics, who
censured, in the severest terms, all these sportive characters (vid.
T. Warton <i>in loco citato</i>, and vide <i>supra</i> not. E, F, &amp;c.).
</p>
<p>
And here I would observe, that although Fauchet and other
subsequent writers affect to arrange the several members of the
minstrel profession under the different classes of <i>troverres</i> (or <i>troubadours</i>),
<i>chanterres</i>, <i>conteours</i>, and <i>jugleurs</i>, &amp;c. (vid. p. <a href="#Page_385">385</a>) as if
they were distinct and separate orders of men, clearly distinguished
from each other by these appropriate terms, we find no sufficient
grounds for this in the oldest writers; but the general names in
Latin, <i>histrio</i>, <i>mimus</i>, <i>joculator</i>, <i>ministrallus</i>, &amp;c. in French, <i>menestrier</i>,
<i>menestrel</i>, <i>jongleur</i>, <i>jugleur</i>, &amp;c. and in English, <i>jogeleur</i>,
<i>jugler</i>, <i>minstrels</i>, and the like, seem to be given them indiscriminately.
And one or other of these names seem to have been sometimes
applied to every species of men, whose business it was to
entertain or divert (<i>joculari</i>) whether with poesy, singing, music,
or gesticulation, singly, or with a mixture of all these. Yet as all
men of this sort were considered as belonging to one class, order
or community (many of the above arts being sometimes exercised
by the same person), they had all of them doubtless the same
privileges, and it equally throws light upon the general history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
the profession to shew what favour or encouragement was given, at
any particular period of time, to any one branch of it. I have not
therefore thought it needful to inquire whether, in the various
passages quoted in these pages, the word minstrel, &amp;c. is always
to be understood in its exact and proper meaning of a singer to the
harp, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
That men of very different arts and talents were included under
the common name of minstrels, &amp;c. appears from a variety of
authorities. Thus we have <i>menestrels de trompes</i> and <i>menestrels</i>
<i>de bouche</i> in the suppl. to Du Cange, c. 1227, and it appears still
more evident from an old French rhymer, whom I shall quote at
large:

<p>
All the before mentioned sports went by the general name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span><i>ministralcia ministellorum ludicra</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Charta an.</i> 1377, <i>apud</i>
Rymer, vii. p. 160. "Peracto autem prandio, ascendebat D. Rex in
cameram suam cum Pr&aelig;latis Magnatibus &amp; Proceribus pr&aelig;dictis:

Ministralciis, pr&aelig; gaudio solempnitatis illius continuarunt." (Du
Cange, <i>Gloss.</i> 773.) This was at the coronation of K. Richard II.
</p>
<p>
It was common for the minstrels to dance, as well as to harp and
sing (see above, note <a href="#Footnote_E_1107" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>, p. <a href="#Page_389">389</a>); thus in the old Romance of <i>Tirante</i>
<i>el Blanco</i>, Val. 1511, the 14th cap. lib. 2, begins thus: "Despues qui
las Mesas fueron al&ccedil;adas vinieron los Ministriles; y delante del rey,
y de la Reyna dan&ccedil;aron un rato: y despues truxeron colacion."
</p>
<p>
They also probably, among their other feats, played tricks of
slight of hand, hence the word jugler came to signify a performer
of legerdemain; and it was sometimes used in this sense (to
which it is now appropriated) even so early as the time of Chaucer,
who in his <i>Squire's Tale</i>, (ii. 108) speaks of the horse of brass, as:

There is a very curious passage in Pasquier's <i>Recherches de la</i>
<i>France</i>, Paris, 1633, folio, liv. 7. ch. 5, p. 611, wherein he appears
to be at a loss how to account for the title of Le Roy assumed by
the old composers of metrical romances; in one of which the author
expressly declares himself to have been a minstrel. The solution
of the difficulty, that he had been <i>Le Roy des Menestrels</i>, will be
esteemed more probable than what Pasquier here advances; for I
have never seen the title of <i>prince</i> given to a minstrel, &amp;c. scil.&mdash;"A

<p>
We see here that in the time of Pasquier the poor minstrel was
sunk into as low estimation in France, as he was then or afterwards
in England: but by his apology for comparing the jouingleurs,
who assembled to exercise their faculty, in his youth, to the
ancient rimeurs, it is plain they exerted their skill in rhyme.

As for king <i>Adenes</i>, or <i>Adenez</i> (whose name in the first passage

the two romances in verse above-mentioned, and a third intitled

about 1270. His <i>Bon Duc Henry</i> I conceive to have been Henry

"Item, pur eschuir plusieurs diseases et mischiefs qont advenuz devaunt
ces heures en la terre de Gales par plusieurs westours
rymours, minstralx et autres vacabondes, ordeignez est et establiz
qe nul westour, rymour ministral ne vacabond soit aucunement
sustenuz en la terre de Gales pur faire kymorthas ou coillage sur la
commune poeple illoeques." This is among the severe laws against
the Welsh, passed during the resentment occasioned by the outrages
committed under Owen Glendour; and as the Welsh bards
had excited their countrymen to rebellion against the English
government, it is not to be wondered that the act is conceived in
terms of the utmost indignation and contempt against this class of
men, who are described as <i>rymours</i>, <i>ministralx</i>, which are apparently
here used as only synonymous terms to express the Welsh bards
with the usual exuberance of our acts of parliament; for if their
<i>ministralx</i> had been mere musicians, they would not have required
the vigilance of the English legislature to suppress them. It was
their songs exciting their countrymen to insurrection which produced
"les diseases &amp; mischiefs en la terre de Gales."
</p>
<p>
It is also submitted to the reader, whether the same application
of the terms does not still more clearly appear in the commission
issued in 1567, and printed in Evan Evans's <i>Specimens of Welsh</i>
<i>Poetry</i>, 1764, 4to. p. v. for bestowing the silver harp on "the chief
of that faculty." For after setting forth "that vagrant and idle
persons, naming themselves <i>minstrels</i>, <i>rythmers</i>, and <i>bards</i>, had
lately grown into such intolerable multitude within the Principality
in North Wales, that not only gentlemen and others by their
shameless disorders are oftentimes disquieted in their habitations,
but also expert <i>minstrels</i> and <i>musicians in tongue and cunynge</i> thereby
much discouraged, &amp;c." and "hindred [of] livings and preferment,"
&amp;c. it appoints a time and place, wherein all "persons that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
intend to maintain their living by name or colour of <i>minstrels</i>,
<i>rythmers</i>, or <i>bards</i> within five shires of North Wales, shall appear
to show their learnings accordingly," &amp;c. And the commissioners
are required to admit such as shall be found worthy, into and
under the degrees heretofore in use, so that they may "use, exercise,
and follow the sciences and faculties of their professions in
such decent order as shall appertain to each of their degrees."
And the rest are to return to some honest labour, &amp;c. upon pain to
be taken as sturdy and idle vagabonds, &amp;c.</p><br /></div>

I cannot conclude this note without observing that in this enumeration
the family minstrels seem to have been musicians only,
and yet both the earl's trumpets and the king's shawmes are
evidently distinguished from the earl's minstrels, and the king's
jugler. Now we find jugglers still coupled with pipers in Barklay's

which I shall produce, not only that the reader may judge of
the resemblance, but to shew how nearly the idea of the minstrel
character given in this essay corresponds with that of our old

</p>
<p>
Sir Lancelot, having been affronted by a threatening abusive letter
which Mark, king of Cornwal, had sent to Queen Guenever,
wherein he "spake shame by her and Sir Lancelot," is comforted
by a knight, named Sir Dinadan, who tells him "I will make a lay
for him, and when it is made, I shall make an harper to sing it before
him. So anon he went and made it, and taught it an harper,
that hyght Elyot; and when hee could it, hee taught it to many
harpers. And so ... the harpers went straight unto Wales and
Cornwaile to sing the lay ... which was the worst lay that ever
harper sung with harpe, or with any other instrument. And [at a]
great feast that king Marke made for joy of [a] victorie which hee
had ... came Eliot the harper; ... and because he was a
curious harper, men heard him sing the same lay that Sir Dinadan
had made, the which spake the most vilanie by king Marke of
his treason, that ever man heard. When the harper had sung
his song to the end, king Marke was wonderous wroth with him,
and said, Thou harper, how durst thou be so bold to sing this
song before me? Sir, said Eliot, wit you wel I am a minstrell, and
I must doe as I am commanded of these lords that <i>I bear the</i>
<i>armes of</i>. And Sir king, wit you well that Sir Dinadan a knight
of the Round Table made this song, and he made me to sing it
before you. Thou saiest well, said king Marke, I charge thee that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
thou hie thee fast out of my sight. So the harper departed, &amp;c."

<i>&amp;c.</i>] Although I conceive that the character ceased to exist, yet
the appellation might be continued, and applied to fidlers, or other
common musicians: which will account for the mistakes of Sir
Peter Leicester, or other modern writers. (See his <i>Historical</i>
<i>Antiquities of Cheshire</i>, 1673, p. 141.)
</p>
<p>
In this sense it is used in an ordinance in the times of Cromwell
(1656), wherein it is enacted that if any of the "persons commonly
called fidlers or minstrels shall at any time be taken playing,
fidling, and making music in any inn, ale-house, or tavern, or
shall be taken proffering themselves, or desiring, or intreating any ...
to hear them play or make music in any of the places aforesaid"
they are to be "adjudged and declared to be rogues,
vagabonds, and sturdy beggars."
</p>
<p>
This will also account why John of Gaunt's king of the
minstrels at length came to be called, like <i>le roy des violons</i>
in France (v. note <a href="#Footnote_BB2_1137" class="fnanchor">[Bb2]</a>), king of the fidlers. See the common
ballad intitled <i>The Pedigree, Education, and Marriage of Robin-hood</i>
<i>with Clorinda, queen of Tutbury Feast</i>: which, though prefixed
to the modern collection on that subject,<a name="FNanchor_1132_1177" id="FNanchor_1132_1177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132_1177" class="fnanchor">[1132]</a> seems of much later date
than most of the others; for the writer appears to be totally
ignorant of all the old traditions concerning this celebrated outlaw,
and has given him a very elegant bride instead of his old noted
Lemman, "Maid Marian:" who together with his chaplain "Frier
Tuck," were his favourite companions, and probably on that account
figured in the old morice dance, as may be seen by the engraving
in Mr Steevens's and Mr. Malone's edition of <i>Shakespeare</i>: by
whom she is mentioned, 1 Hen. IV. act iii. sc. 3. (See also Warton,
i. 245, ii. 237.) Whereas from this ballad's concluding with an
exhortation to "pray for the king," and "that he may get children,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>&amp;c. it is evidently posterior to the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and
can scarce be older than the reign of K. Charles I. for K. James
I. had no issue after his accession to the throne of England. It
may even have been written since the Restoration, and only express
the wishes of the nation for issue on the marriage of their favourite
K. Charles II., on his marriage with the Infanta of Portugal. I
think it is not found in the Pepys collection.</p><br /></div>

evidently from the French <i>balade</i>, as the latter is from the Italian
<i>ballata</i>; which the Crusca Dictionary defines, <i>canzone che si canta</i>
<i>ballando</i>: "a song which is sung during a dance." So Dr. Burney
(ii. 342,) who refers to a collection of <i>ballette</i>, published by
Gastaldi, and printed at Antwerp in 1596 (iii. 226.)
</p>
<p>
But the word appears to have had an earlier origin: for in the
decline of the Roman empire, these trivial songs were called
<i>ballistea</i> and <i>saltatiuncul&aelig;</i>. <i>Ballisteum</i>, Salmasius says, is properly
<i>ballistium</i>, Gr. &Beta;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&epsilon;&#x1FD6;&omicron;&nu;. "&#x1F00;&pi;&#x1F78; &tau;&omicron;&#x1FE6; &Beta;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&#x1F77;&zeta;&omega; ... &Beta;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#x1F77;&alpha;
saltatio ... <i>Ballistium</i> igitur est quod vulgo vocamus <i>ballet</i>; nam
inde deducta vox nostra." Salmas. <i>Not. in</i> Hist. Ang. Scriptores,
iv. p. 349.
</p>
<p>
In the life of the Emperor Aurelian by Fl. Vopiscus may be
seen two of these <i>ballistea</i>, as sung by the boys skipping and
dancing, on account of a great slaughter made by the emperor
with his own hand in the Sarmatic war. The first is:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mille, mille, mille decollavimus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unus homo mille decollavimus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mille vivat, qui mille occidit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tantum vini habet nemo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quantum fudit sanguinis."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
The other was:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mille Sarmatas, mille Francos<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Semel &amp; semel occidimus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mille Persas qu&aelig;rimus."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Salmasius (<i>in loc.</i>) shows that the trivial poets of that time were
wont to form their metre of trochaic tetrametre catalectics, divided
into distichs. (<i>Ibid.</i> p. <a href="#Page_350">350</a>.) This becoming the metre of the hymns
in the church service, to which the monks at length superadded
rhyming terminations, was the origin of the common trochaic
metre in the modern languages. This observation I owe to the
learned author of <i>Irish Antiquities</i>, 4to.</p><br /></div>

The old English names for one of this profession were gleeman,<a name="FNanchor_1134_1179" id="FNanchor_1134_1179"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134_1179" class="fnanchor">[1134]</a>

In French he was called <i>jongleur</i> or <i>jugleur</i>, <i>menestrel</i> or <i>menestrier</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1136_1181" id="FNanchor_1136_1181"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136_1181" class="fnanchor">[1136]</a>
The writers of the middle ages expressed the character in Latin
by the words <i>joculator</i>, <i>mimus</i>, <i>histrio</i>, <i>ministrellus</i>, &amp;c. These
terms, however modern critics may endeavour to distinguish and
apply them to different classes, and although they may be sometimes
mentioned as if they were distinct, I cannot find after a
very strict research to have had any settled appropriate difference,
but they appear to have been used indiscriminately by the oldest
writers, especially in England, where the most general and comprehensive
name was latterly minstrel, Lat. <i>ministrellus</i>, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
Thus <i>joculator</i> (Eng. jogeler, or juglar) is used as synonymous to
<i>citharista</i> (note <a href="#Footnote_K_1112" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> p. <a href="#Page_397">397</a>), and to <i>cantor</i> (p. <a href="#Page_397">397</a>), and to minstrel
(vid. <i>infra</i>, p. <a href="#Page_425">425</a>). We have also positive proof that the subject
of his songs were gestes and romantic tales (<a href="#Footnote_V2_1128" class="fnanchor">[V2]</a> note).
</p>
<p>
So <i>mimus</i> is used as synonymous to <i>joculator</i> (<a href="#Footnote_M_1114" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> p. <a href="#Page_399">399</a>). He
was rewarded for his singing (<a href="#Footnote_N_1115" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> p. <a href="#Page_400">400</a>) and he both sang, harped,
and dealt in that sport <a href="#Footnote_T2_1123" class="fnanchor">[T2]</a> which is elsewhere called <i>ars joculatoria</i>
(<a href="#Footnote_M_1114" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> <i>ubi supra</i>).
</p>
<p>
Again <i>histrio</i> is also proved to have been a singer (<a href="#Footnote_Z_1133" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> p. <a href="#Page_412">412</a>)
and to have gained rewards by his <i>verba joculatoria</i> (<a href="#Footnote_E_1107" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> p. <a href="#Page_388">388</a>). And
<i>histriones</i> is the term by which the Fr. word <i>ministraulx</i> is most
frequently rendered into Latin (<a href="#Footnote_W_1130" class="fnanchor">[W]</a> p. <a href="#Page_410">410</a>, <a href="#Footnote_BB_1136" class="fnanchor">[Bb]</a> p. <a href="#Page_416">416</a>, &amp;c.)
</p>
<p>
The fact therefore is sufficiently established that this order of
men were in England, as well as on the Continent, singers: so that
it only becomes a dispute about words, whether here under the
more general name of minstrels, they are described as having sung.
</p>
<p>
But in proof of this we have only to turn to so common a book
as T. Warton's <i>History of Eng. Poetry</i>: where we shall find extracted
from records the following instances:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Ex Registr. Priorat. S. Swithin Winton (sub anno 1374). In
festo Alwyni Epi.... Et durante pietancia in Aula Conventus
sex ministralli, cum quatuor citharisatoribus, faciebant ministralcias
suas. Et post cenam, in magna camera arcuata dom. prioris cantabant
idem Gestum in qua Camera suspendebatur, ut moris est,
magnum dorsale Prioris habens picturas trium Regum Colein.
Veniebant autem dicti joculatores a Castello domini Regis &amp; ex
familia Epi." (vol. ii. p. 174). Here the minstrels and harpers are
expressly called <i>joculatores</i>, and as the harpers had musical instruments,
the singing must have been by the minstrels, or by both
conjointly.
</p>
<p>
For that minstrels sang we have undeniable proof in the following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>entry in the Accompt Roll of the Priory of Bicester, in Oxfordshire
(under the year 1432). "<i>Dat. Sex</i> ministrallis de <i>Bokyngham</i>
cantantibus <i>in refectorio Martyrium Septem Domientium in festo Epiphanie</i>,
ivs." (vol. ii. p. 175).
</p>
<p>
In like manner our old English writers abound with passages
wherein the minstrel is represented as singing. To mention only
a few:
</p>
<p>
In the old romance of <i>Emar&eacute;</i> (No. 15, vol. iii. appendix), which
from the obsoleteness of the style, the nakedness of the story,
the barrenness of incidents, and some other particulars, I should
judge to be next in point of time to <i>Hornchild,</i> we have:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I have herd menstrelles syng yn sawe."&mdash;Stanza 27.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
In a poem of Adam Davie (who flourished about 1312) we have
this distich:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Merry it is in halle to here the harpe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Minstrelles synge, the jogelours carpe."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p class="right">T. Warton, i. p. 225.</p>
<p>
So William of Nassyngton (circ. 1480) as quoted by Mr. Tyrwhitt
(<i>Chaucer</i>, iv. 319):&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I will make no vain carpinge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dedes of armys ne of amours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dus Mynstrelles and Jestours [Gestours]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That makys carpinge in many a place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Octaviane and Isembrase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of many other Jestes [Gestes]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And namely whan they come to festes."<a name="FNanchor_1137_1182" id="FNanchor_1137_1182"></a><a href="#Footnote_1137_1182" class="fnanchor">[1137]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
See also the description of the minstrel in note <a href="#Footnote_EE_1143" class="fnanchor">[Ee]</a> from <i>Morte</i>
<i>Arthur</i>, which appears to have been compiled about the time of
this last writer. (See T. Warton, ii. 235).
</p>
<p>
By proving that minstrels were singers of the old romantic songs
and gestes, &amp;c. we have in effect proved them to have been the
makers at least of some of them. For the names of their authors
being not preserved, to whom can we so probably ascribe the composition
of many of these old popular rhimes, as to the men who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>devoted all their time and talents to the recitation of them: especially
as in the rhimes themselves minstrels are often represented
as the makers or composers.
</p>
<p>
Thus in the oldest of all, <i>Hornchild</i> having assumed the character
of a harper or jogeler, is in consequence said (fo. 92). to have
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"made Rymenild [his mistress] a lay."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
In the old romance of <i>Emar&eacute;</i>, we have this exhortation to
minstrels, as composers, otherwise they could not have been at
liberty to chuse their subjects (st. 2):&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Menstrelles that walken fer and wyde<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her and ther in every a syde<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In mony a dyverse londe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sholde ut her bygynnyng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speke of that ryghtwes kyng<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That made both see and sonde," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
And in the old song or geste of <i>Guy and Colbronde</i> (No. 4,
vol. iii. appendix), the minstrel thus speaks of himself in the first
person:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When meate and drinke is great plentye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lords and ladyes still wil be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And sitt and solace lythe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then itt is time for <i>mee</i> to speake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of keene knights and kempes great<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such carping for to kythe."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
We have seen already that the Welsh bards, who were undoubtedly
composers of the songs they chanted to the harp, could not
be distinguished by our legislators from our own rimers, minstrels
(vid. note <a href="#Footnote_BB3_1138" class="fnanchor">[Bb3]</a>, p. <a href="#Page_418">418</a>).
</p>
<p>
And that the Proven&ccedil;al <i>troubadour</i> of our King Richard, who is
called by M. Favine <i>jongleur</i>, and by M. Fauchet <i>menestrel</i>, is by
the old English translator termed a rimer or minstrel, when he is
mentioning the fact of his composing some verses (p. 359).
</p>
<p>
And lastly, that Holinshed, translating the prohibition of K.
Henry V., forbidding any songs to be composed on his victory, or to
be sung by harpers or others, roundly gives it, he would not permit
"any ditties to be made and sung by minstrels on his glorious victory,"
&amp;c. (vid. p. <a href="#Page_370">370</a> and note <a href="#Footnote_BB4_1139" class="fnanchor">[Bb4]</a>).
</p>
<p>
Now that this order of men, at first called gleemen, then juglers,
and afterwards more generally minstrels, existed here from the
Conquest, who entertained their hearers with chanting to the harp
or other instruments, songs and tales of chivalry, or as they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
called, gests<a name="FNanchor_1138_1183" id="FNanchor_1138_1183"></a><a href="#Footnote_1138_1183" class="fnanchor">[1138]</a> and romances in verse in the English language, is
proved by the existence of the very compositions they so chanted,
which are still preserved in great abundance, and exhibit a regular
series from the time our language was almost Saxon, till after its
improvements in the age of Chaucer, who enumerates many of
them. And as the Norman French was in the time of this bard
still the courtly language, it shows that the English was not thereby
excluded from affording entertainment to our nobility, who are
so often addressed therein by the title of lordings: and sometimes
more positively "lords and ladies" (p. 427).
</p>
<p>
And tho' many of these were translated from the French, others
are evidently of English origin<a name="FNanchor_1139_1184" id="FNanchor_1139_1184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1139_1184" class="fnanchor">[1139]</a> which appear in their turns to have
afforded versions into that language; a sufficient proof of that intercommunity
between the French and English minstrels, which
hath been mentioned in a preceding page. Even the abundance
of such translations into English being all adapted for popular recitation,
sufficiently establishes the fact that the English minstrels
had a great demand for such compositions, which they were glad
to supply, whether from their own native stores or from other languages.
</p>
<p>
We have seen above that the <i>joculator</i>, <i>mimus</i>, <i>histrio</i>, whether
these characters were the same, or had any real difference, were all
called minstrels; as was also the harper,<a name="FNanchor_1140_1185" id="FNanchor_1140_1185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1140_1185" class="fnanchor">[1140]</a> when the term implied
a singer, if not a composer of songs, &amp;c. By degrees the name of
minstrel was extended to vocal and instrumental musicians of every
kind: and as in the establishment of royal and noble houses, the
latter would necessarily be most numerous, so we are not to wonder
that the band of music (entered under the general name of minstrels)
should consist of instrumental performers chiefly, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
altogether; for as the composer or singer of heroic tales to the harp
would necessarily be a solitary performer, we must not expect to
find him in the band along with the trumpeters, fluters, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
However, as we sometimes find mention of "Minstrels of Music:"<a name="FNanchor_1141_1186" id="FNanchor_1141_1186"></a><a href="#Footnote_1141_1186" class="fnanchor">[1141]</a>
so at other times we hear of "expert minstrels and musicians
of tongue and cunning" (B b. iii. p. 418)<a name="FNanchor_1142_1187" id="FNanchor_1142_1187"></a><a href="#Footnote_1142_1187" class="fnanchor">[1142]</a>, meaning doubtless by
the former singers, and probably by the latter phrase composers of
songs. Even "minstrels music" seems to be applied to the species
of verse used by minstrels in the passage quoted below.<a name="FNanchor_1143_1188" id="FNanchor_1143_1188"></a><a href="#Footnote_1143_1188" class="fnanchor">[1143]</a>
</p>
<p>
But although from the predominancy of instrumental music minstrelsy
was at length chiefly to be understood in this sense, yet it
was still applied to the poetry of minstrels so late as the time of
Queen Elizabeth, as appears in the following extract from Puttenham's
<i>Arte of Eng. Poesie</i>, p. 9, who, speaking of the first composers
of Latin verses in ryme, says, "all that they wrote to the
favour or prayse of princes, they did it in such manner of minstralsie;
and thought themselves no small fooles, when they could
make their verses go all in ryme."
</p>
<p>
I shall conclude this subject with the following description of
minstrelcy given by John Lidgate at the beginning of the fifteenth
century, as it shows what a variety of entertainments were then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>comprehended under this term, together with every kind of instrumental
music then in use.

<p>&#9755; The foregoing essay on the ancient minstrels has been very
much enlarged and improved since the first edition, with respect
to the Anglo-Saxon minstrels, in consequence of some objections
proposed by the reverend and learned Mr. Pegge, which the reader
may find in the second volume of the <i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, printed by the
Antiquarian Society: but which that gentleman has since retracted
in the most liberal and candid manner in the third volume of the
<i>Arch&aelig;ologia</i>, No. xxxiv. p. 310.</p>

<p>And in consequence of similar objections respecting the English
minstrels after the Conquest, the subsequent part hath been much
enlarged, and additional light thrown upon the subject; which, to
prevent cavil, hath been extended to minstrelsy in all its branches,
as it was established in England, whether by natives or foreigners.</p></div>

was Gleeman (see below, note <a href="#Footnote_I_1111" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>, sect. 1), so that wherever the
term minstrel is in these pages applied to it before the Conquest,
it must be understood to be only by anticipation. Another early
name for this profession in English was jogeler, or jocular, Lat.
<i>joculator</i>. (See p. <a href="#Page_353">353</a>, as also note <a href="#Footnote_V2_1128" class="fnanchor">[V2]</a> and note <a href="#Footnote_Q_1118" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a>.) To prevent
confusion, we have chiefly used the more general word minstrel,
which (as the author of the <i>Observ. on the Statutes</i> hath suggested
to the editor) might have been originally derived from a diminutive
of the Lat. <i>minister</i>, scil. <i>ministerellus</i>, <i>ministrellus</i>.]</p></div>

and ingenious author of <i>Irish Antiquities</i>, 4to. that the ancient
<i>mimi</i> among the Romans had their heads and beards shaven, as is
shown by Salmasius in Notis ad <i>Hist. August. Scriptores VI. Paris</i>,
1622, fol. p. 385. So that this peculiarity had a classical origin,
though it afterwards might make the minstrels sometimes pass for
ecclesiastics, as appears from the instance given below. Dr. Burney
tells us that <i>histriones</i> and <i>mimi</i> abounded in France in the
time of Charlemagne (ii. 221), so that their profession was handed
down in regular succession from the time of the Romans, and
therewith some leading distinctions of their habit or appearance;
yet with a change in their arts of pleasing, which latterly were
most confined to singing and music.</p></div>

in the fourteenth century. Froissart describing a Christmas entertainment
given by the Comte de Foix, tells us, that "there were
many mynstrels, as well of hys own, as of straungers, and eache of
them dyd their devoyre in their faculties. The same day the Erle
of Foix gave to haraulds and minstrelles the som of fyve hundred
frankes: and gave to the Duke of Tourayns mynstreles gownes of

For they apparently derived this part of their dress, &amp;c. from the
<i>mimi</i> of the ancient Romans, who had their heads and beards
shaven (see above p. <a href="#Page_383">383</a> note <a href="#Footnote_1105_1150" class="fnanchor">[1105]</a>), as they likewise did the mimickry,
and other arts of diverting, which they superadded to the composing
and singing to the harp heroic songs, &amp;c. which they inherited
from their own progenitors the bards and scalds of the ancient
Celtic and Gothic nations. The Longobardi had, like other
northern people, brought these with them into Italy. For "in the
year 774, when Charlemagne entered Italy and found his passage
impeded, he was met by a minstrel of Lombardy, whose song promised
him success and victory. <i>Contigit</i> joculatorem <i>ex</i> Longobardorum
<i>gente ad Carolum venire, et</i> cantiunculam a se compositam,
<i>rotando in conspectu suorum, cantare</i>." Tom. ii. p. 2. <i>Chron.</i>

French minstrels, as it had also been with the Anglo-Saxon (<i>vid.</i>
p. 393): thus in an ancient Fr. MS. in the Harl. collection (2253,
75), a minstrel is described as riding on horseback, and bearing
his tabour.

See also a passage in Menage's <i>Diction. Etym.</i> (v. <i>menestriers</i>,)
where <i>tabours</i> is used as synonymous to <i>menestriers</i>.

<p>
Another frequent instrument with them was the viele. This, I
am told, is the name of an instrument at this day, which differs
from a guitar, in that the player turns round a handle at the top
of the instrument, and with his other hand, plays on some keys,
that touch the chords, and produce the sound.

it hath been thought to afford decisive proof of a translation
from the <i>Romance</i>, or French language. Accordingly it is so urged
by T. Warton (i. 146, note), from two passages in the pr. copy of
<i>Sir Eglamour</i>, viz., Sign. E. i.
</p>

And the other thus:

<p>
So that I believe references to "the Romaunce," or the like, were
often meer expletive phrases inserted by the oral reciters; one of

the manner that the copy was printed.</p></div>

Of what nature the performance of the joculator was, we
may learn from the register of St. Swithin's Priory at Winchester
(T. Warton, i. 69): "Et cantabat Joculator quidam nomine Herebertus
Canticum Colbrondi, necnon Gestum Emme regine a judicio
ignis liberate, in aula Prioris." His instrument was sometimes the
fythele, or fiddle, Lat. <i>fidicula</i>: which occurs in the Anglo-Saxon
lexicon. On this subject we have a curious passage from a
MS. of the <i>Lives of the Saints</i> in metre, supposed to be earlier than
the year 1200 (T. Warton's <i>Hist.</i> i. p. 17), viz.:

Nor can I agree with him in the representation he has given (p.
367) concerning the <i>Cymmorth</i> or meeting, wherein the bards
exerted their powers to excite their countrymen to war; as if it
were by a deduction of the particulars he enumerates, and, as it
should seem, in the way of harangue, &amp;c. After which, "the band
of minstrels ... struck up; the harp, the <i>crwth</i>, and the pipe
filled the measures of enthusiasm, which the others had begun to
inspire." Whereas it is well known that the bard chanted his enthusiastic
effusions to the harp; and as for the term minstrel, it
was not, I conceive, at all used by the Welsh; and in English it
comprehended both the bard and the musician.</p></div>

<p class="drop-capi"><span class="smcap">It</span> is well known that dramatic poetry in
this and most other nations of Europe
owes its origin, or at least its revival, to
those religious shows which in the dark
ages were usually exhibited on the more solemn
festivals. At those times they were wont to represent
in the churches the lives and miracles of the
saints, or some of the more important stories of
scripture. And as the most mysterious subjects
were frequently chosen, such as the Incarnation,
Passion, and Resurrection of Christ, &amp;c., these exhibitions
acquired the general name of mysteries. At
first they were probably a kind of dumb shews, intermingled,
it may be, with a few short speeches; at
length they grew into a regular series of connected
dialogues, formally divided into acts and scenes.
Specimens of these in their most improved state
(being at best but poor artless compositions) may be
seen among Dodsley's <i>Old Plays</i> and in Osborne's
<i>Harleyan Miscel</i>. How they were exhibited in their
most simple form we may learn from an ancient novel,
often quoted by our old dramatic poets<a name="FNanchor_1145_1190" id="FNanchor_1145_1190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1145_1190" class="fnanchor">[1145]</a> intitled ...

language, in which he is named <i>Ulenspiegle</i>. Howleglass,
whose waggish tricks are the subject of this
book, after many adventures comes to live with a
priest, who makes him his parish clerk. This priest is
described as keeping a leman or concubine, who had
but one eye, to whom Howleglass owed a grudge
for revealing his rogueries to his master. The story
thus proceeds: ... "And than in the meane season,
while Howleglas was parysh clarke, at Easter they
should play the Resurrection of our Lorde: and for
because than the men wer not learned, nor could
not read, the priest toke his leman, and put her in
the grave for an Aungell: and this seing Howleglas,
toke to hym iij of the symplest persons that
were in the towne, that played the iij Maries; and
the Person [<i>i.e.</i> Parson or Rector] played Christe,
with a baner in his hand. Than saide Howleglas to
the symple persons. Whan the Aungel asketh you,
whome you seke, you may saye, The parsons leman
with one iye. Than it fortuned that the tyme was
come that they must playe, and the Aungel asked
them whom they sought, and than sayd they, as
Howleglas had shewed and lerned them afore, and
than answered they, We seke the priests leman with
one iye. And than the prieste might heare that he
was mocked. And whan the priestes leman herd
that, she arose out of the grave, and would have
smyten with her fist Howleglas upon the cheke, but
she missed him and smote one of the simple persons
that played one of the thre Maries; and he gave her
another; and than toke she him by the heare [hair];
and that seing his wyfe, came running hastely to
smite the priestes leaman; and than the priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
seeing this, caste down hys baner and went to helpe his
woman, so that the one gave the other sore strokes,
and made great noyse in the churche. And than
Howleglas seyng them lyinge together by the eares
in the bodi of the churche, went his way out of the
village, and came no more there."<a name="FNanchor_1147_1192" id="FNanchor_1147_1192"></a><a href="#Footnote_1147_1192" class="fnanchor">[1147]</a></p>

<p>As the old mysteries frequently required the representation
of some allegorical personage, such as
Death, Sin, Charity, Faith, and the like, by degrees
the rude poets of those unlettered ages began to
form compleat dramatic pieces consisting entirely of
such personifications. These they intitled moral
plays, or moralities. The mysteries were very inartificial,
representing the scripture stories simply according
to the letter. But the moralities are not
devoid of invention: they exhibit outlines of the
dramatic art; they contain something of a fable or
plot, and even attempt to delineate characters and
manners. I have now before me two that were
printed early in the reign of Henry VIII., in which,
I think, one may plainly discover the seeds of
tragedy and comedy, for which reason I shall give a
short analysis of them both.</p>

<p>One of them is intitled <i>Every Man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1148_1193" id="FNanchor_1148_1193"></a><a href="#Footnote_1148_1193" class="fnanchor">[1148]</a> The
subject of this piece is the summoning of man out
of the world by death; and its moral, that nothing
will then avail him but a well-spent life and the comforts
of religion. This subject and moral are
opened in a monologue spoken by the Messenger
(for that was the name generally given by our ancestors
to the prologue on their rude stage); then God<a name="FNanchor_1149_1194" id="FNanchor_1149_1194"></a><a href="#Footnote_1149_1194" class="fnanchor">[1149]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>is represented, who, after some general complaints
on the degeneracy of mankind, calls for Deth,
and orders him to bring before his tribunal Every-man,
for so is called the personage who represents
the human race. Every-man appears, and receives
the summons with all the marks of confusion and
terror. When Death is withdrawn Every-man applies
for relief in this distress to Fellowship, Kindred,
Goods, or Riches, but they successively renounce
and forsake him. In this disconsolate state he betakes
himself to Good-dedes, who, after upbraiding
him with his long neglect of her,<a name="FNanchor_1150_1195" id="FNanchor_1150_1195"></a><a href="#Footnote_1150_1195" class="fnanchor">[1150]</a> introduces him
to her sister Knowledge, and she leads him to the
"holy man Confession," who appoints him penance;
this he inflicts upon himself on the stage, and then
withdraws to receive the sacraments of the priest.
On his return he begins to wax faint, and after
Strength, Beauty, Discretion, and Five Wits<a name="FNanchor_1151_1196" id="FNanchor_1151_1196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1151_1196" class="fnanchor">[1151]</a>
have all taken their final leave of him, gradually expires
on the stage, Good-dedes still accompanying
him to the last. Then an Aungell descends to sing
his requiem, and the epilogue is spoken by a person
called Doctour, who recapitulates the whole and
delivers the moral:&mdash;</p>

<p>From this short analysis it may be observed that
<i>Every Man</i> is a grave, solemn piece, not without
some rude attempts to excite terror and pity, and
therefore may not improperly be referred to the class
of tragedy. It is remarkable that in this old simple
drama the fable is conducted upon the strictest
model of the Greek tragedy. The action is simply
one, the time of action is that of the performance,
the scene is never changed, nor the stage ever
empty. Every-man, the hero of the piece, after his
first appearance never withdraws, except when he
goes out to receive the sacraments, which could not
well be exhibited in public, and during his absence
Knowledge descants on the excellence and power of
the priesthood, somewhat after the manner of the
Greek chorus. And, indeed, except in the circumstance
of Every-man's expiring on the stage, the
Sampson Agonistes of Milton is hardly formed on a
severer plan.<a name="FNanchor_1152_1197" id="FNanchor_1152_1197"></a><a href="#Footnote_1152_1197" class="fnanchor">[1152]</a></p>

<p>The other play is intitled <i>Hick Scorner</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1153_1198" id="FNanchor_1153_1198"></a><a href="#Footnote_1153_1198" class="fnanchor">[1153]</a> and
bears no distant resemblance to comedy; its chief
aim seems to be to exhibit characters and manners,
its plot being much less regular than the foregoing.
The prologue is spoken by Pity, represented under
the character of an aged pilgrim; he is joined by
Contemplacyon and Perseverance, two holy men,
who, after lamenting the degeneracy of the age,
declare their resolution of stemming the torrent.
Pity then is left upon the stage, and presently found
by Frewyll, representing a lewd debauchee, who,
with his dissolute companion Imaginacion, relate
their manner of life, and not without humour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
describe the stews and other places of base resort.
They are presently joined by Hick-Scorner, who is
drawn as a libertine returned from travel, and, agreeably
to his name, scoffs at religion. These three are
described as extremely vicious, who glory in every
act of wickedness; at length two of them quarrel,
and Pity endeavours to part the fray; on this they
fall upon him, put him in the stocks, and there leave
him. Pity, thus imprisoned, descants in a kind of
lyric measure on the profligacy of the age, and in
this situation is found by Perseverance and Contemplacion,
who set him at liberty, and advise him to go
in search of the delinquents. As soon as he is gone
Frewill appears again, and, after relating in a very
comic manner some of his rogueries and escapes
from justice, is rebuked by the two holy men, who,
after a long altercation, at length convert him and
his libertine companion Imaginacioun from their
vicious course of life, and then the play ends with a
few verses from Perseverance by way of epilogue.
This and every morality I have seen conclude with
a solemn prayer. They are all of them in rhyme, in
a kind of loose stanza, intermixed with distichs.</p>

<p>It would be needless to point out the absurdities
in the plan and conduct of the foregoing play; they
are evidently great. It is sufficient to observe that
bating the moral and religious reflection of Pity, etc.,
the piece is of a comic cast, and contains a humorous
display of some of the vices of the age. Indeed,
the author has generally been so little attentive to
the allegory, that we need only substitute other names
to his personages, and we have real characters and
living manners.</p>

<p>We see then that the writers of these moralities
were upon the very threshold of real tragedy and
comedy, and therefore we are not to wonder that
tragedies and comedies in form soon after took place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
especially as the revival of learning about this time
brought them acquainted with the Roman and
Grecian models.</p>

<p>II. At what period of time the moralities had
their rise here it is difficult to discover, but plays
of miracles appear to have been exhibited in England
soon after the Conquest. Matthew Paris tells
us that Geoffrey, afterwards Abbot of St. Albans, a
Norman, who had been sent for over by Abbot
Richard to take upon him the direction of the school
of that monastery, coming too late, went to Dunstable
and taught in the Abby there, where he
caused to be acted (probably by his scholars) a miracle-play
of St. Catharine, composed by himself.<a name="FNanchor_1154_1199" id="FNanchor_1154_1199"></a><a href="#Footnote_1154_1199" class="fnanchor">[1154]</a>
This was long before the year 1119, and probably
within the eleventh century. The above play of
St. Catharine was, for aught that appears, the first
spectacle of this sort that was exhibited in these
kingdoms, and an eminent French writer thinks it
was even the first attempt towards the revival of
dramatic entertainments in all Europe, being long
before the representations of mysteries in France,
for these did not begin till the year 1398.<a name="FNanchor_1155_1200" id="FNanchor_1155_1200"></a><a href="#Footnote_1155_1200" class="fnanchor">[1155]</a></p>

<p>But whether they derived their origin from the
above exhibition or not, it is certain that holy plays,
representing the miracles and sufferings of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>saints, were become common in the reign of Henry
II., and a lighter sort of interludes appear not to
have been then unknown.<a name="FNanchor_1156_1201" id="FNanchor_1156_1201"></a><a href="#Footnote_1156_1201" class="fnanchor">[1156]</a> In the subsequent
age of Chaucer, "Plays of Miracles" in Lent were
the common resort of idle gossips.<a name="FNanchor_1157_1202" id="FNanchor_1157_1202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1157_1202" class="fnanchor">[1157]</a></p>

<p>They do not appear to have been so prevalent on
the Continent, for the learned historian of the Council
of Constance<a name="FNanchor_1158_1203" id="FNanchor_1158_1203"></a><a href="#Footnote_1158_1203" class="fnanchor">[1158]</a> ascribes to the English the introduction
of plays into Germany. He tells us that
the Emperor, having been absent from the Council
for some time, was at his return received with great
rejoicings, and that the English fathers in particular
did upon that occasion cause a sacred comedy to be
acted before him on Sunday, Jan. 31, 1417, the
subjects of which were:&mdash;"The Nativity of our
Saviour;" "The Arrival of the Eastern Magi;"
and "The Massacre by Herod." Thence it appears,
says this writer, that the Germans are obliged to the
English for the invention of this sort of spectacles,
unknown to them before that period.</p>

<p>The fondness of our ancestors for dramatic exhibitions
of this kind, and some curious particulars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>relating to this subject, will appear from the <i>Houshold</i>
<i>Book</i> of the fifth Earl of Northumberland, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>

show that the exhibiting Scripture dramas on the
great festivals entered into the regular establishment,
and formed part of the domestic regulations of our
ancient nobility, and, what is more remarkable, that
it was as much the business of the chaplain in those
days to compose plays for the family as it is now for
him to make sermons.</p>

<p>III. It hath been observed already that plays of
miracles, or mysteries, as they were called, led to the
introduction of moral plays, or moralities, which prevailed
so early and became so common that towards
the latter end of K. Henry VII.'s reign John Rastel,
brother-in-law to Sir Thomas More, conceived a
design of making them the vehicle of science and
natural philosophy. With this view he published.
<i>A new interlude and a mery of the nature of the</i>
<i>iiii. elements declarynge many proper points of philosophy</i>
<i>naturall, and of dyvers straunge landys</i><a name="FNanchor_1163_1208" id="FNanchor_1163_1208"></a><a href="#Footnote_1163_1208" class="fnanchor">[1163]</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>&amp;c. It is observable that the poet speaks of the
discovery of America as then recent:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----"Within this xx yere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Westwarde be founde new landes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we never harde tell of before this," &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The West Indies were discovered by Columbus
in 1492, which fixes the writing of this play to about
1510 (two years before the date of the above <i>Houshold</i>
<i>Book</i>). The play of <i>Hick-Scorner</i> was probably
somewhat more ancient, as he still more imperfectly
alludes to the American discoveries, under
the name of "the Newe founde Ilonde." [Sign. A.
vij.]</p>

<p>It is observable that in the older moralities, as in
that last mentioned, <i>Every-man</i>, &amp;c., is printed no
kind of stage direction for the exits and entrances of
the personages, no division of acts and scenes. But
in the moral interlude of <i>Lusty Juventus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1164_1209" id="FNanchor_1164_1209"></a><a href="#Footnote_1164_1209" class="fnanchor">[1164]</a> written
under Edward VI. the exits and entrances begin to
be noted in the margin.<a name="FNanchor_1165_1210" id="FNanchor_1165_1210"></a><a href="#Footnote_1165_1210" class="fnanchor">[1165]</a> At length in Q. Elizabeth's
reign moralities appeared formally divided
into acts and scenes with a regular prologue, &amp;c.
One of these is reprinted by Dodsley.</p>

<p>Before we quit this subject of the very early
printed plays, it may just be observed that although
so few are now extant it should seem many were
printed before the reign of Q. Elizabeth, as at the
beginning of her reign her injunctions in 1559 are
particularly directed to the suppressing of "many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>Pamphlets, Playes, and Ballads; that no manner of
person shall enterprize to print any such, &amp;c." but
under certain restrictions. Vid. Sect. V.</p>

<p>In the time of Hen. VIII. one or two dramatic
pieces had been published under the classical names
of comedy and tragedy,<a name="FNanchor_1166_1211" id="FNanchor_1166_1211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1166_1211" class="fnanchor">[1166]</a> but they appear not to
have been intended for popular use. It was not till
the religious ferments had subsided that the public
had leisure to attend to dramatic poetry. In the
reign of Elizabeth tragedies and comedies began to
appear in form, and could the poets have persevered
the first models were good. <i>Gorboduc</i>, a regular
tragedy, was acted in 1561;<a name="FNanchor_1167_1212" id="FNanchor_1167_1212"></a><a href="#Footnote_1167_1212" class="fnanchor">[1167]</a> and Gascoigne, in
1566, exhibited <i>Jocasta</i>, a translation from Euripides,
as also <i>The Supposes</i>, a regular comedy from
Ariosto, near thirty years before any of Shakespeare's
were printed.</p>

<p>The people, however, still retained a relish for their
old mysteries and moralities,<a name="FNanchor_1168_1213" id="FNanchor_1168_1213"></a><a href="#Footnote_1168_1213" class="fnanchor">[1168]</a> and the popular
dramatic poets seem to have made them their
models. From the graver sort of moralities our
modern tragedy appears to have derived its origin,
as our comedy evidently took its rise from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>lighter interludes of that kind. And as most of
these pieces contain an absurd mixture of religion
and buffoonery, an eminent critic<a name="FNanchor_1169_1214" id="FNanchor_1169_1214"></a><a href="#Footnote_1169_1214" class="fnanchor">[1169]</a> has well deduced
from thence the origin of our unnatural tragi-comedies.
Even after the people had been accustomed
to tragedies and comedies moralities still
kept their ground. One of them, intitled <i>The New</i>
<i>Custom</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1170_1215" id="FNanchor_1170_1215"></a><a href="#Footnote_1170_1215" class="fnanchor">[1170]</a> was printed so late as 1573. At length
they assumed the name of masques,<a name="FNanchor_1171_1216" id="FNanchor_1171_1216"></a><a href="#Footnote_1171_1216" class="fnanchor">[1171]</a> and with
some classical improvements, became in the two
following reigns the favourite entertainments of the Court.</p>

<p>IV. The old mysteries, which ceased to be acted
after the Reformation, appear to have given birth to
a third species of stage exhibition, which, though
now confounded with tragedy and comedy, were by
our first dramatic writers considered as quite distinct
from them both. These were historical plays
or histories, a species of dramatic writing which resembled
the old mysteries in representing a series
of historical events simply in the order of time in
which they happened, without any regard to the
three great unities. These pieces seem to differ
from tragedies just as much as historical poems do
from epic: as the Pharsalia does from the &AElig;neid.</p>

<p>What might contribute to make dramatic poetry
take this form was, that soon after the mysteries
ceased to be exhibited, was published a large collection
of poetical narratives, called <i>The Mirrour for</i>
<i>Magistrates</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1172_1217" id="FNanchor_1172_1217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1172_1217" class="fnanchor">[1172]</a> wherein a great number of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>most eminent characters in English history are
drawn relating their own misfortunes. This book
was popular, and of a dramatic cast; and therefore,
as an elegant writer<a name="FNanchor_1173_1218" id="FNanchor_1173_1218"></a><a href="#Footnote_1173_1218" class="fnanchor">[1173]</a> has well observed, might
have its influence in producing historical plays.
These narratives probably furnished the subjects,
and the ancient mysteries suggested the plan.</p>

<p>There appears indeed to have been one instance
of an attempt at an historical play itself, which was
perhaps as early as any mystery on a religious
subject, for such, I think, we may pronounce the
representation of a memorable event in English
history, that was expressed in actions and rhimes.
This was the old Coventry play of Hock-Tuesday,<a name="FNanchor_1174_1219" id="FNanchor_1174_1219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1174_1219" class="fnanchor">[1174]</a>
founded on the story of the massacre of the
Danes, as it happened on St. Brice's night, November
13, 1002.<a name="FNanchor_1175_1220" id="FNanchor_1175_1220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1175_1220" class="fnanchor">[1175]</a> The play in question was performed
by certain men of Coventry, among the
other shews and entertainments at Kenelworth
Castle, in July, 1575, prepared for Queen Elizabeth,
and this the rather "because the matter
mentioneth how valiantly our English women, for
the love of their country, behaved themselves."</p>

<p>The writer, whose words are here quoted,<a name="FNanchor_1176_1221" id="FNanchor_1176_1221"></a><a href="#Footnote_1176_1221" class="fnanchor">[1176]</a> hath
given a short description of the performance, which
seems on that occasion to have been without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
recitation or rhimes, and reduced to meer dumb-show;
consisting of violent skirmishes and encounters, first
between Danish and English "lance-knights on
horseback," armed with spear and shield, and afterwards
between "hosts" of footmen, which at length
ended in the Danes being "beaten down, overcome,
and many led captive by our English women."<a name="FNanchor_1177_1222" id="FNanchor_1177_1222"></a><a href="#Footnote_1177_1222" class="fnanchor">[1177]</a></p>

<p>This play, it seems, which was wont to be exhibited
in their city yearly, and which had been of
great antiquity and long continuance there,<a name="FNanchor_1178_1223" id="FNanchor_1178_1223"></a><a href="#Footnote_1178_1223" class="fnanchor">[1178]</a> had
of late been suppressed at the instance of some well-meaning
but precise preachers, of whose "sourness"
herein the townsmen complain, urging that
their play was "without example of ill-manners, papistry,
or any superstition;"<a name="FNanchor_1179_1224" id="FNanchor_1179_1224"></a><a href="#Footnote_1179_1224" class="fnanchor">[1179]</a> which shews it to
have been entirely distinct from a religious mystery.<a name="FNanchor_1180_1225" id="FNanchor_1180_1225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1180_1225" class="fnanchor">[1180]</a>
But having been discontinued, and, as
appears from the narrative, taken up of a sudden
after the sports were begun, the players apparently
had not been able to recover the old rhimes, or to
procure new ones to accompany the action: which,
if it originally represented "the outrage and importable
insolency of the Danes, the grievous complaint
of Huna, king Ethelred's chieftain in wars,"<a name="FNanchor_1181_1226" id="FNanchor_1181_1226"></a><a href="#Footnote_1181_1226" class="fnanchor">[1181]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>his counselling and contriving the plot to dispatch
them, concluding with the conflicts above mentioned,
and their final suppression&mdash;"expressed in actions
and rhimes after their manner,"<a name="FNanchor_1182_1227" id="FNanchor_1182_1227"></a><a href="#Footnote_1182_1227" class="fnanchor">[1182]</a> one can hardly
conceive a more regular model of a compleat drama;
and, if taken up soon after the event, it must have
been the earliest of the kind in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_1183_1228" id="FNanchor_1183_1228"></a><a href="#Footnote_1183_1228" class="fnanchor">[1183]</a></p>

<p>Whatever this old play, or "storial show,"<a name="FNanchor_1184_1229" id="FNanchor_1184_1229"></a><a href="#Footnote_1184_1229" class="fnanchor">[1184]</a> was
at the time it was exhibited to Q. Elizabeth, it had
probably our young Shakespeare for a spectator, who
was then in his twelfth year, and doubtless attended
with all the inhabitants of the surrounding country at
these "princely pleasures of Kenelworth,"<a name="FNanchor_1185_1230" id="FNanchor_1185_1230"></a><a href="#Footnote_1185_1230" class="fnanchor">[1185]</a> whence
Stratford is only a few miles distant. And as the
Queen was much diverted with the Coventry play,
"whereat her Majestic laught well," and rewarded the
performers with two bucks, and five marks in money,
who, "what rejoicing upon their ample reward, and
what triumphing upon the good acceptance, vaunted
their play was never so dignified, nor ever any
players before so beatified;" but especially if our
young bard afterwards gained admittance into the
castle to see a play, which the same evening, after
supper, was there "presented of a very good theme,
but so set forth by the actors' well handling, that
pleasure and mirth made it seem very short, though
it lasted two good hours and more,"<a name="FNanchor_1186_1231" id="FNanchor_1186_1231"></a><a href="#Footnote_1186_1231" class="fnanchor">[1186]</a> we may
imagine what an impression was made on his infant
mind. Indeed the dramatic cast of many parts of
that superb entertainment which continued nineteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>days, and was the most splendid of the kind ever
attempted in this kingdom; the addresses to the
Queen in the personated characters of a sybille, a
savage man, and Sylvanus, as she approached or
departed from the castle, and on the water by Arion,
a Triton, or the Lady of the Lake, must have had a
very great effect on a young imagination whose
dramatic powers were hereafter to astonish the
world.</p>

<p>But that the historical play was considered by our
old writers, and by Shakespeare himself, as distinct
from tragedy and comedy, will sufficiently appear
from various passages in their works. "Of late
days," says Stow, "in place of those stage-playes<a name="FNanchor_1187_1232" id="FNanchor_1187_1232"></a><a href="#Footnote_1187_1232" class="fnanchor">[1187]</a>
hath been used comedies, tragedies, enterludes,
and histories both true and fayned."<a name="FNanchor_1188_1233" id="FNanchor_1188_1233"></a><a href="#Footnote_1188_1233" class="fnanchor">[1188]</a> Beaumont
and Fletcher, in the prologue to <i>The Captain</i>, say:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This is nor Comedy, nor Tragedy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor History."&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Polonius in <i>Hamlet</i> commends the actors as the
best in the world, "either for tragedie, comedie, historie,
pastorall," &amp;c. And Shakespeare's friends,
Heminge and Condell, in the first folio edit. of
his plays, in 1623,<a name="FNanchor_1189_1234" id="FNanchor_1189_1234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1189_1234" class="fnanchor">[1189]</a> have not only intitled their
book "Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories,
and Tragedies," but in their table of contents
have arranged them under those three several
heads; placing in the class of histories "K. John,
Richard II. Henry IV. 2 pts. Henry V. Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>VI. 3 pts. Rich. III. and Henry VIII.", to which
they might have added such of his other plays as
have their subjects taken from the old chronicles, or
Plutarch's <i>Lives</i>.</p>

<p>Although Shakespeare is found not to have been
the first who invented this species of drama,<a name="FNanchor_1190_1235" id="FNanchor_1190_1235"></a><a href="#Footnote_1190_1235" class="fnanchor">[1190]</a> yet
he cultivated it with such superior success, and
threw upon this simple inartificial tissue of scenes
such a blaze of genius, that his histories maintain
their ground in defiance of Aristotle and all the
critics of the classic school, and will ever continue
to interest and instruct an English audience.
Before Shakespeare wrote, historical plays do not
appear to have attained this distinction, being not
mentioned in Q. Elizabeth's licence in 1574<a name="FNanchor_1191_1236" id="FNanchor_1191_1236"></a><a href="#Footnote_1191_1236" class="fnanchor">[1191]</a> to
James Burbage and others, who are only impowered
"to use, exercyse, and occupie the arte and facultye
of playenge Commedies, Tragedies, Enterludes,
Stage-Playes, and such other like." But when
Shakespeare's histories had become the ornaments
of the stage, they were considered by the publick, and
by himself, as a formal and necessary species, and
are thenceforth so distinguished in public instruments.
They are particularly inserted in the licence
granted by K. James I. in 1603,<a name="FNanchor_1192_1237" id="FNanchor_1192_1237"></a><a href="#Footnote_1192_1237" class="fnanchor">[1192]</a> to W. Shakespeare
himself, and the players his fellows; who are
authorized "to use and exercise the arte and faculty
of playing Comedies, Tragedies, Histories, Interludes,
Morals, Pastorals, Stage-Plaies, and such like."</p>

<p>The same merited distinction they continued to
maintain after his death, till the theatre itself was
extinguished: for they are expressly mentioned in a
warrant in 1622, for licensing certain "late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
Comedians of Q. Anne deceased, to bring up children in
the qualitie and exercise of playing Comedies, Histories,
Interludes, Morals, Pastorals, Stage-Plaies, and
such like."<a name="FNanchor_1193_1238" id="FNanchor_1193_1238"></a><a href="#Footnote_1193_1238" class="fnanchor">[1193]</a> The same appears in an admonition
issued in 1637<a name="FNanchor_1194_1239" id="FNanchor_1194_1239"></a><a href="#Footnote_1194_1239" class="fnanchor">[1194]</a> by Philip, Earl of Pembroke and
Montgomery, then Lord Chamberlain, to the master
and wardens of the Company of Printers and Stationers,
wherein is set forth the complaint of his
Majesty's servants the players, that "diverse of
their books of Comedyes and Tragedyes, Chronicle-Historyes,
and the like," had been printed and published
to their prejudice, &amp;c.</p>

<p>This distinction, we see, prevailed for near half
a century; but after the Restoration, when the
stage revived for the entertainment of a new race
of auditors, many of whom had been exiled in
France, and formed their taste from the French
theatre, Shakespeare's histories appear to have
been no longer relished; at least the distinction
respecting them is dropt in the patents that were
immediately granted after the king's return.
This appears not only from the allowance to
Mr. William Beeston in June, 1660,<a name="FNanchor_1195_1240" id="FNanchor_1195_1240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1195_1240" class="fnanchor">[1195]</a> to use
the house in Salisbury-court "for a Play-house,
wherein Comedies, Tragedies, Tragi-comedies, Pastoralls,
and Interludes, may be acted," but also from
the fuller grant (dated August 21, 1760),<a name="FNanchor_1196_1241" id="FNanchor_1196_1241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1196_1241" class="fnanchor">[1196]</a> to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>Thomas Killigrew, Esq., and Sir William Davenant,
Knt., by which they have authority to erect two
companies of players, and to fit up two theatres "for
the representation of Tragydies, Comedyes, Playes,
Operas, and all other entertainments of that nature."</p>

<p>But while Shakespeare was the favourite dramatic
poet, his histories had such superior merit that he
might well claim to be the chief, if not the only historic
dramatist that kept possession of the English
stage; which gives a strong support to the tradition
mentioned by Gildon,<a name="FNanchor_1197_1242" id="FNanchor_1197_1242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1197_1242" class="fnanchor">[1197]</a> that, in a conversation
with Ben Jonson, our bard vindicated his historical
plays by urging, that as he had found "the
nation in general very ignorant of history, he wrote
them in order to instruct the people in this particular."
This is assigning not only a good motive,
but a very probable reason for his preference of this
species of composition; since we cannot doubt but
his illiterate countrymen would not only want such
instruction when he first began to write, notwithstanding
the obscure dramatic chroniclers who preceded
him, but also that they would highly profit
by his admirable lectures on English history so long
as he continued to deliver them to his audience.
And as it implies no claim to his being the <i>first</i> who
introduced our chronicles on the stage, I see not
why the tradition should be rejected.</p>

<p>Upon the whole we have had abundant proof that
both Shakespeare and his contemporaries considered
his histories, or historical plays, as of a legitimate
distinct species, sufficiently separate from tragedy
and comedy, a distinction which deserves the particular
attention of his critics and commentators;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>who, by not adverting to it, deprive him of his
proper defence and best vindication for his neglect
of the unities, and departure from the classical
dramatic forms. For, if it be the first canon of
sound criticism to examine any work by whatever
rule the author prescribed for his own observance,
then we ought not to try Shakespeare's histories
by the general laws of tragedy or comedy. Whether
the rule itself be vicious or not is another inquiry:
but certainly we ought to examine a work only by
those principles according to which it was composed.
This would save a deal of impertinent criticism.</p>

<p>V. We have now brought the inquiry as low as
was intended, but cannot quit it without entering
into a short description of what may be called the
&oelig;conomy of the ancient English stage.</p>

<p>Such was the fondness of our forefathers for
dramatic entertainments, that not fewer than nineteen
playhouses had been opened before the year
1633, when Prynne published his <i>Histriomastix</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1198_1243" id="FNanchor_1198_1243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1198_1243" class="fnanchor">[1198]</a>
From this writer it should seem that "tobacco, wine,
and beer,"<a name="FNanchor_1199_1244" id="FNanchor_1199_1244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1199_1244" class="fnanchor">[1199]</a> were in those days the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
accommodations in the theatre, as within our memory
at Sadler's Wells.</p>

<p>With regard to the players themselves, the several
companies were (as hath been already shewn),<a name="FNanchor_1200_1245" id="FNanchor_1200_1245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1200_1245" class="fnanchor">[1200]</a> retainers
or menial servants to particular noblemen,<a name="FNanchor_1201_1246" id="FNanchor_1201_1246"></a><a href="#Footnote_1201_1246" class="fnanchor">[1201]</a>
who protected them in the exercise of their profession:
and many of them were occasionally strollers,
that travelled from one gentleman's house to another.
Yet so much were they encouraged, that, notwithstanding
their multitude, some of them acquired
large fortunes. Edward Allen, who founded Dulwich
College, is a known instance. And an old
writer speaks of the very inferior actors, whom he
calls the hirelings, as living in a degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
splendour which was thought enormous in that frugal
age.<a name="FNanchor_1202_1247" id="FNanchor_1202_1247"></a><a href="#Footnote_1202_1247" class="fnanchor">[1202]</a></p>

<p>At the same time the ancient prices of admission
were often very low. Some houses had penny
benches.<a name="FNanchor_1203_1248" id="FNanchor_1203_1248"></a><a href="#Footnote_1203_1248" class="fnanchor">[1203]</a> The "two-penny gallery" is mentioned
in the prologue to Beaumont and Fletcher's
<i>Woman Hater</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1204_1249" id="FNanchor_1204_1249"></a><a href="#Footnote_1204_1249" class="fnanchor">[1204]</a> and seats of three-pence and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>a groat seem to be intended in the passage of
Prynne above referred to. Yet different houses
varied in their prices: that playhouse called the
"Hope" had seats of five several rates, from sixpence
to half-a-crown.<a name="FNanchor_1205_1250" id="FNanchor_1205_1250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1205_1250" class="fnanchor">[1205]</a> But a shilling seems to
have been the usual price<a name="FNanchor_1206_1251" id="FNanchor_1206_1251"></a><a href="#Footnote_1206_1251" class="fnanchor">[1206]</a> of what is now called
the pit, which probably had its name from one of
the playhouses having been a cock-pit.<a name="FNanchor_1207_1252" id="FNanchor_1207_1252"></a><a href="#Footnote_1207_1252" class="fnanchor">[1207]</a></p>

<p>The day originally set apart for theatrical exhibition
appears to have been Sunday, probably because
the first dramatic pieces were of a religious cast.
During a great part of Queen Elizabeth's reign, the
playhouses were only licensed to be opened on that
day:<a name="FNanchor_1208_1253" id="FNanchor_1208_1253"></a><a href="#Footnote_1208_1253" class="fnanchor">[1208]</a> but before the end of her reign, or soon
after, this abuse was probably removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span></p>

<p>The usual time of acting was early in the afternoon,<a name="FNanchor_1209_1254" id="FNanchor_1209_1254"></a><a href="#Footnote_1209_1254" class="fnanchor">[1209]</a>
plays being generally performed by day-light.<a name="FNanchor_1210_1255" id="FNanchor_1210_1255"></a><a href="#Footnote_1210_1255" class="fnanchor">[1210]</a>
All female parts were performed by men,
no English actress being ever seen on the public
stage<a name="FNanchor_1211_1256" id="FNanchor_1211_1256"></a><a href="#Footnote_1211_1256" class="fnanchor">[1211]</a> before the civil wars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, with regard to the playhouse furniture and
ornaments, a writer of King Charles II.'s time,<a name="FNanchor_1212_1257" id="FNanchor_1212_1257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1212_1257" class="fnanchor">[1212]</a>
who well remembered the preceding age, assures us
that in general "they had no other scenes nor decorations
of the stage, but only old tapestry, and
the stage strewed with rushes, with habits accordingly."<a name="FNanchor_1213_1258" id="FNanchor_1213_1258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1213_1258" class="fnanchor">[1213]</a></p>

<p>Yet Coryate thought our theatrical exhibitions,
&amp;c., splendid when compared with what he saw
abroad. Speaking of the Theatre for Comedies
at Venice, he says: "The house is very beggarly
and base in comparison of our stately playhouses
in England, neyther can their actors compare with
ours for apparrell, shewes, and musicke. Here
I observed certaine things that I never saw before:
For I saw women act, a thing that I never saw
before, though I have heard that it hath been sometimes
used in London; and they performed it with
as good a grace, action, gesture, and whatsoever
convenient for a player, as ever I saw any masculine actor."<a name="FNanchor_1214_1259" id="FNanchor_1214_1259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1214_1259" class="fnanchor">[1214]</a></p>

<p>It ought, however, to be observed, that amid such
a multitude of playhouses as subsisted in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
metropolis before the Civil Wars, there must have been a
great difference between their several accommodations,
ornaments, and prices; and that some would
be much more shewy than others, though probably
all were much inferior in splendor to the two great
theatres after the Restoration.</p>

is thought to have written in the reign of Henry II. and to have

"their old storial show" (p. 32). And so it might be as represented
and expressed by them "after their manner" (p. 33): although
we are also told by Bevil Higgons, that St. Brice's Eve was
still celebrated by the northern English in commemoration of this
massacre of the Danes, the women beating brass instruments, and
singing old rhimes, in praise of their cruel ancestors. See his

in the preface to Dodsley's <i>Old Plays</i>. Nay, it appears
from Rymer's MSS. that twenty-three playhouses had been at

time. See Malone's <i>Shakesp.</i> vol. i. pt. ii. p. 48.</p></div>

"How many are there, who, according to their several qualities,
spend 2<i>d.</i> 3<i>d.</i> 4<i>d.</i> 6<i>d.</i> 12<i>d.</i> 18<i>d.</i> 2<i>s.</i> and sometimes 4<i>s.</i> or 5<i>s.</i> at a
playhouse, day by day, if coach-hire, boat-hire, tobacco, wine,
beere, and such like vaine expences, which playes doe usually
occasion, be cast into the reckoning?" Prynne's <i>Histriom.</i> p.
322.
</p>
<p>
But that tobacco was smoaked in the playhouses appears from
Taylor the Water-poet, in his <i>Proclamation for Tobacco's</i>
<i>Propagation</i>: "Let play-houses, drinking-schools, taverns, &amp;c. be continually
haunted with the contaminous vapours of it; nay (if it be
possible) bring it into the churches, and there choak up their
preachers." (<i>Works</i>, p. 253.) And this was really the case at
Cambridge: James I. sent a letter in 1607 against "taking Tobacco"
in St. Mary's. So I learn from my friend Dr. Farmer.
</p>
<p>
A gentleman has informed me that once, going into a church in
Holland, he saw the male part of the audience sitting with their
hats on, smoking tobacco, while the preacher was holding forth in
his morning-gown.</p></div>

old invective against the stage, called <i>A third Blast of Retrait</i>
<i>from Plaies</i>, &amp;c., 1580, 12mo., says: "Alas! that private affection
should so raigne in the nobilitie, that to pleasure their servants,
and to upholde them in their vanitye, they should restraine the
magistrates from executing their office!... They [the nobility]
are thought to be covetous by permitting their servants ... to
live at the devotion or almes of other men, passing from countrie
to countrie, from one gentleman's house to another, offering their
service, which is a kind of beggerie. Who indeede, to speake
more trulie, are become beggers for their servants. For comonlie
the good-wil, men beare to their Lordes, makes them draw the

23, says thus of what he terms in his margin Players-men: "Over
lashing in apparel is so common a fault, that the very hyerlings of
some of our Players, which stand at revirsion of vi<i>s.</i> by the week,
jet under gentlemens noses in sutis of silke, exercising themselves
to prating on the stage, and common scoffing when they come
abrode, where they look askance over the shoulder at every man,
of whom the Sunday before they begged an almes. I speake not
this, as though everye one that professeth the qualitie so abused
himselfe, for it is well knowen, that some of them are sober, discreete,
properly learned, honest housholders and citizens, well-thought
on among their neighbours at home." [he seems to mean
Edw. Allen above mentioned] "though the pryde of their shadowes
(I mean those hangbyes, whom they succour with stipend)
cause them to be somewhat il-talked of abroad."
</p>
<p>
In a subsequent period we have the following satirical fling at
the shewy exterior and supposed profits of the actors of that time.
Vid. Greene's <i>Groatsworth of Wit</i>, 1625, 4to.: "What is your
profession?"&mdash;"Truly, Sir, ... I am a Player." "A Player?...
I took you rather for a Gentleman of great living; for, if by
outward Habit men should be censured, I tell you, you would be
taken for a substantial man." "So I am where I dwell....
What, though the world once went hard with me, when I was
fayne to carry my playing-fardle a foot-backe: <i>Tempora mutantur</i> ...
for my very share in playing apparrell will not be sold for
two hundred pounds.... Nay more, I can serve to make a
pretty speech, for I was a country Author, passing at a Moral,"
&amp;c. See <i>Roberto's Tale</i>, sign. D. 3. b.</p></div>

writer (see Malone's <i>Shakesp.</i> vol. i. part ii. p. 59), who thinks it
questionable, because, in St. Mary's church at Cambridge, the
area that is under the pulpit, and surrounded by the galleries, is
(<i>now</i>) called the pit; which, he says, no one can suspect to have
been a <i>Cockpit</i>, or that a playhouse phrase could be applied to a
church. But whoever is acquainted with the licentiousness of
boys, will not think it impossible that they should thus apply a
name so peculiarly expressive of its situation: which from frequent
use might at length prevail among the senior members of the
University; especially when those young men became seniors
themselves. The name of Pit, so applied at Cambridge, must be
deemed to have been a cant phrase, until it can be shewn that the
area in other churches was usually so called.</p></div>

of the players, says, "These, because they are allowed to play
every Sunday, make iiii. or v. Sundayes at least every week," fol.
24. So the author of <i>A Second and Third Blast of Retrait from</i>
<i>Plaies</i>, 1580, 12mo. "Let the magistrate but repel them from
the libertie of plaeing on the Sabboth-daie.... To plaie on
the Sabboth is but a priviledge of sufferance, and might with ease
be repelled, were it thoroughly followed." P. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>-<a href="#Page_62">62</a>. So again:
"Is not the Sabboth of al other daies the most abused?....
Wherefore abuse not so the Sabboth-daie, my brethren; leave not
the temple of the Lord." ... "Those unsaverie morsels of
unseemelie sentences passing out of the mouth of a ruffenlie plaier,
doth more content the hungrie humors of the rude multitude, and
carrieth better rellish in their mouthes, than the bread of the
worde, &amp;c." Vid. p. <a href="#Page_63">63</a>, <a href="#Page_65">65</a>, <a href="#Page_69">69</a>, &amp;c. I do not recollect that exclamations
of this kind occur in Prynne, whence I conclude that
this enormity no longer subsisted in this time.

<p>
It should also seem, from the author of the <i>Third Blast</i> above
quoted, that the churches still continued to be used occasionally
for theatres. Thus, in p. <a href="#Page_77">77</a>, he says, that the players (who, as
hath been observed, were servants of the nobility), "under the
title of their maisters, or as reteiners, are priviledged to roave
abroad, and permitted to publish their mametree in everie temple
of God, and that throughout England, unto the horrible contempt
of praier."</p></div>

<i>Actor</i>) "in the best leasure of our life, that is, betweene meales;
the most unfit time either for study or bodily exercise." Even so
late as in the reign of Charles II. plays generally began at three in
the afternoon.</p></div>

Prynne speaks of it as an unusual enormity, that "they had Frenchwomen
actors in a play not long since personated in Blackfriars
playhouse." This was in 1629, vid. p. 215. And tho' female
parts were performed by men or boys on the public stage, yet in
masques at Court, the Queen and her ladies made no scruple to
perform the principal parts, especially in the reigns of James I.
and Charles I.

Sir William Davenant, after the restoration, introduced women,
scenery, and higher prices. See Cibber's <i>Apology for his own Life</i>.</p></div>

one of the principal theatres in his time, viz. the Globe on the
Bankside, Southwark (which Ben Jonson calls the "Glory of the
Bank, and Fort of the whole Parish"), had been covered with
thatch till it was burnt down in 1613. (See Taylor's <i>Sculler</i>, Epig.
22, p. 31. Jonson's <i>Execration on Vulcan</i>.)
</p>
<p>
Puttenham tells us they used vizards in his time, "partly to
supply the want of players, when there were more parts than there
were persons, or that it was not thought meet to trouble ...
princes chambers with too many folkes." [<i>Art of Eng. Poes.</i>
1589, p. 26.] From the last clause, it should seem that they were
chiefly used in the masques at Court.</p></div>
